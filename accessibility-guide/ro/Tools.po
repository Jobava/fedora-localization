"The biggest advantage of the hardware speech solutions is that speech is "
"available before the operating system loads, which even makes it possible "
"for people with a visual impairment to install the operating system. "
"Hardware solutions include speech synthesizers, braille terminals, braille "
"printers, sip and puff systems, and eye gaze pointing devices. These devices "
"are usually very expensive and it is difficult to find drivers for them. "
"Drivers are being written (mostly for speech synthesizers) for Linux but "
"they need to be tested and integrated by the community into \"upstream\" "
"software projects before becoming part of Fedora."
