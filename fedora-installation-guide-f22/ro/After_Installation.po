msgid "After the Installation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This chapter describes the initial setup tools which open after you finish "
"the installation, reboot the system, and log in for the first time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Two separate configuration tools are part of &PRODUCT;. If you installed the "
"<application>GNOME</application> desktop environment (the default &PRODUCT; "
"environment, installed for example as part of the &PRODUCT; Workstation "
"flavor), the <application>GNOME Initial Setup</application> utility will "
"open; for all other graphical environments, the <application>Initial Setup</"
"application> tool serves the same purpose."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Both of these tools will allow you to configure user-specific settings which "
"have not been configured during the installation. Some of the settings are "
"available both in the graphical installer (or as Kickstart commands) as well "
"as in the initial-setup utilities; in that case, they will only be displayed "
"after the first reboot if you skipped them during the installation. This "
"means that, for example, if you configured a user account before the "
"installation finished, you will not be prompted to do so again after the "
"installation completes."
msgstr ""

msgid "GNOME Initial Setup"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The <application>GNOME Initial Setup</application> utility will be displayed "
"after you log in for the first time with any user account, as long as your "
"first login is in the <application>GNOME</application> desktop environment."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This utility allows you to configure several user-specific settings, such as "
"system language or the default keyboard layout. Use the <guilabel>Next</"
"guilabel> and <guilabel>Previous</guilabel> buttons at the top of the window "
"to navigate between screens. Some screens (<guilabel>Configure online "
"accounts</guilabel> in particular) are optional and can be skipped using the "
"<guilabel>Skip</guilabel> button in the top right corner."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After you finish configuring all screens, click <guilabel>Start using "
"Fedora</guilabel> to exit the utility. After that, the <guilabel>Getting "
"Started</guilabel> page from GNOME help will be displayed, and you can "
"either browse the help content, or close it and start using your desktop."
msgstr ""

msgid "Common Post-installation Tasks"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After you finish the installation and go through one of the initial setup "
"utilities described above, your system is ready for use. However, other "
"administrative tasks not covered by the installer or the initial setup "
"utilities may still be necessary, depending on how you plan to use your "
"system. The list below describes some of the more common tasks usually "
"performed immediately after a new installation."
msgstr ""

msgid "Recover a lost <systemitem class=\"username\">root</systemitem> password"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The <systemitem class=\"username\">root</systemitem> password, which is "
"configured during the installation, is required for accessing the system as "
"the <systemitem class=\"username\">root</systemitem> user. Without this "
"password you will not be able to configure your system or install additional "
"software. If you lost or forgot your <systemitem class=\"username\">root</"
"systemitem> password, you can reset it by following the steps described in "
"<xref linkend=\"sect-trouble-after-reset-root-password\" />."
msgstr ""

msgid "Configure the network"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In most cases, network access is configured during the installation process, "
"either in the <application>Anaconda</application> installation program (see "
"<xref linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-network-configuration\" />) or in a "
"Kickstart file (see <xref linkend=\"sect-kickstart-commands-network\" />). "
"For information on configuring the network after the installation, see the "
"<citetitle>&PRODUCT; Networking Guide</citetitle>, available at <ulink url="
"\"http://docs.fedoraproject.org/\" />."
msgstr ""

msgid "Perform an initial system update"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you installed &PRODUCT; from a full installation ISO image (such as the "
"Workstation live image or full Server DVD), it is recommended to perform an "
"initial system update, because your installation media likely contained "
"older versions of software packages. During the initial update, all "
"installed packages are updated to their latest available versions. Updates "
"to packages provide security fixes, bug fixes and enhancements."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The <application>DNF</application> package manager is used for updating "
"installed packages. For more information about updating your system with "
"<application>DNF</application>, see the <citetitle>&PRODUCT; System "
"Administrator's Guide</citetitle>, available at <ulink url=\"http://docs."
"fedoraproject.org/\" />."
msgstr ""

msgid "Install driver updates"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Usually, drivers for system devices are already supported in the kernel "
"provided by Red&nbsp;Hat Enterprise&nbsp;Linux. However, occasionally, "
"support for devices that have been released recently could be missing. In "
"these cases, a driver update enabling your device may be available."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Devices necessary to complete the installation can have driver updates "
"provided before the installation begins. If a device is missing a driver, "
"but it is not essential during the installation, it is recommended to wait "
"until after the installation completes, and install additional drivers "
"afterwards. For instructions on installing and enabling additional drivers "
"on the installed system using <application>RPM</application> and "
"<application>DNF</application>, see the <citetitle>&PRODUCT; System "
"Administrator's Guide</citetitle>, available at <ulink url=\"http://docs."
"fedoraproject.org/\" />."
msgstr ""

msgid "Configure additional repositories"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"New software is installed from <firstterm>package repositories</firstterm>. "
"Package repositories are organized sets of software and metadata that can be "
"accessed by the <application>DNF</application> package manager. By default, "
"several update repositories provided by &PRODUCT; are configured "
"automatically and you can install updates and additional software from those."
" However, if you want to set up additional repositories, for example ones "
"containing your own software, some extra steps are needed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For information about configuring additional software repositories, see the "
"<citetitle>&PRODUCT; System Administrator's Guide</citetitle>, available at "
"<ulink url=\"http://docs.fedoraproject.org/\" />."
msgstr ""

msgid "Install additional packages"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can control which packages will be installed by selecting an environment "
"in the <systemitem>Software Selection</systemitem> dialog in the graphical "
"installation (see <xref linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-software-selection\" "
"/>). This dialog does not provide a way to choose individual packages, only "
"predefined sets. However, you can use the <application>DNF</application> "
"package manager to install additional packages after the installation. See "
"the <citetitle>&PRODUCT; System Administrator's Guide</citetitle>, available "
"at <ulink url=\"http://docs.fedoraproject.org/\" />, for more information."
msgstr ""

msgid "Switch to a graphical login"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Depending on the options you chose during the installation process, it is "
"possible that your system does not have a graphical interface, instead "
"offering only a text-based prompt. If this is the case and you wish to "
"enable a graphical desktop after the installation, you must install the "
"<application>X Window System</application> and your preferred desktop "
"environment (either <application>GNOME</application> or <application>KDE</"
"application>)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As with all other software, these packages can be installed using the "
"<application>DNF</application> package manager. For information about using "
"<application>DNF</application> to install new packages, see the "
"<citetitle>&PRODUCT; System Administrator's Guide</citetitle>, available at "
