msgid "Boot Options"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The <application>Anaconda</application> installer includes a range of boot "
"options for administrators, which modify the default behavior of the "
"installation program by enabling or disabling certain functions. To use one "
"or more boot options, you either have to boot from installation media and "
"append these options at the boot menu (see <xref linkend=\"sect-boot-menu\" /"
">), or you must add them into your PXE server configuration file if you are "
"booting from a network (see <xref linkend=\"chap-pxe-server-setup\" />)."

msgid "There are two basic types of options described in this chapter:"

msgid ""
"Options presented as ending with an \"equals\" sign (<literal>=</literal>) "

"example, the <option>inst.vncpassword=</option> option must also contain a "
"value (in this case, a password). The correct form is therefore <option>inst."
"vncpassword=<replaceable>password</replaceable></option>. On its own, "
"without a password specified, the option is invalid."

msgid ""
"Options presented without the \"<literal>=</literal>\" sign do not accept "

"Boot options specific to the installation program always start with "
