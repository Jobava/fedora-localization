msgid "Preparing to Boot"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After you have made a bootable USB flash drive or a CD or DVD using the "
"steps described in <xref linkend=\"sect-preparing-boot-media\" />, you are "
"ready to boot the installation. Note that the steps described below are "
"generic and the exact steps will vary somewhat depending on your system - "
"particularly on your motherboard manufacturer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are no separate media provided for BIOS and UEFI systems; all of them "
"can boot from the same ISO image. However, once you install &PRODUCT;, you "
"can not switch between UEFI and BIOS. The system must run on the same "
"firmware it was installed on; if you, for example, perform the installation "
"on an UEFI system in UEFI mode, and then switch it to BIOS compatibility "
"mode, &PRODUCT; will no longer boot and will require a reinstallation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"&PRODUCT; does not support UEFI booting for 32-bit x86 systems. Only BIOS "
"boot is supported on these systems."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Also note that &PRODUCT; only fully supports version 2.2 of the UEFI "
"specification. Hardware that supports version 2.3 or later will boot and "
"work normally, but the additional functionality defined by these later "
"specifications will not be available. The UEFI specifications are available "
"from <ulink url=\"http://www.uefi.org/specs/agreement/\" />."

msgid ""
"Plug in the boot USB drive, or insert the boot CD or DVD into your "
"computer's optical disc drive. Alternatively, if you plan on booting from a "
"network boot (PXE) server, make sure that the network cable is plugged in."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Restart the system. Once it starts rebooting, it should display a prompt "
"similar to the following (usually at the bottom of the screen):"
msgstr ""

msgid "Press F12 to select boot device, or Del to enter SETUP"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Follow the on-screen instructions to access the boot menu. If no "
"instructions are displayed (some systems only display a graphical logo "
"during early stages of boot), try pressing <keycap>F12</keycap>, "
"<keycap>F11</keycap>, <keycap>F10</keycap> or <keycap>Del</keycap> several "
"times; these are most commonly used keys. Note that there is usually a very "
"short time window provided to access the menu; once it passes, you need to "
"restart the system and try again."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some older systems may not support choosing a boot device at startup. In "
"that case, enter the system's SETUP (BIOS), and change the default boot "
"order so that your boot media (CD, DVD, USB or network) have higher priority "
"than internal hard drives."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When your system's boot menu opens, select an entry such as <guilabel>Boot "

msgid "The Boot Menu"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In most cases, when you boot the &PRODUCT; installer from your prepared boot "
"media or server, the boot menu will the the first thing that appears. From "
"this menu, you can either start the actual installation, or you can use the "
"boot media to rescue an existing system."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The way the boot menu will look and function will vary somewhat depending on "
"your system's firmware - BIOS systems use the <application>SYSLINUX</"
"application> boot loader, and UEFI systems use <application>GRUB2</"
"application>. However, both of the menus described below function very "
"similarly from a user's point of view."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use arrow keys to select an entry in the menu, and <keycap>Enter</keycap> to "
"confirm your selection. The first two entries in the list will both proceed "
"with the installation; the first one will start the installer directly, and "
"the second one will verify the integrity of the boot media before starting "
"the installation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The final entry in the list is <guilabel>Troubleshooting</guilabel>; this is "
"a submenu. Selecting this entry and pressing <keycap>Enter</keycap> will "
"display a new set of selections, where you can choose to install in basic "
"graphics mode (useful if you want to do a manual graphical installation but "
"your system has issues with the default graphical installer), rescue an "
"existing system, or test your system's memory modules for errors (on BIOS "
"systems only). The troubleshooting menu also allows you to exit the boot "
"menu and boot normally from your system's hard drive via the <guilabel>Boot "
"from local drive</guilabel> option."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Every menu entry in the list is a predefined set of boot options, and these "
"options can be customized to change some aspects of the installer's behavior."
" To edit the default set of boot options, press <keycap>Tab</keycap> on BIOS "
"systems, or <keycap>e</keycap> on UEFI systems. The key to use is also "
"displayed at the bottom of the screen."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Editing boot options in <application>GRUB2</application> (on UEFI systems) "
