msgid "Manual Partitioning"

msgid ""
"The <guilabel>Manual Partitioning</guilabel> screen allows you to create a "
"storage configuration for your &PRODUCT; system manually, giving you a "
"greater control over your system's storage."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In most other installers for both Linux and other operating systems, disk "
"partitioning usually takes a \"bottom-up\" approach. In these installers, "
"you first create underlying devices such as LVM physical volumes, then you "
"create a layout such as LVM on top of them, then you create file systems on "
"top of logical volumes, and the last step is usually assigning a mount point "
"to each volume as needed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<application>Anaconda</application> uses an opposite approach. First, you "
"create all separate mount points you need, and everything needed to create "
"them (creating a volume group, logical volumes inside it, and physical "
"volumes where the volume group will reside) is performed automatically. You "
"can then adjust the automatic settings as you require."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"No permanent changes will be made to your disks during the actual "
"partitioning process. The configuration you have selected will only be "
"written to your system after you press the <guilabel>Begin installation</"
"guilabel> button in <xref linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-installation-"
"summary\" />."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you first open the <guilabel>Manual Partitioning</guilabel> screen, the "
"column on the left side will display all previously existing partitions on "
"all drives which you selected as installation targers in <xref linkend="
"\"sect-installation-gui-storage-partitioning\" />. If none of the selected "
"drives contain any existing partitions, then a message informing you that no "
"mount points currently exist will appear."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here, you can choose a partitioning scheme such as <guilabel>LVM</guilabel> "
"or <guilabel>BTRFS</guilabel> and click the <guilabel>Click here to create "
"them automatically</guilabel> to prompt the installer to create a basic "
"partitioning layout; this layout follows the guidelines described in <xref "
"linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-manual-partitioning-recommended\" />. The "
"created layout is a basic layout where partition/volume sizes are determined "
"automatically based on the total amount of available space."

"Click the <guilabel>+</guilabel> button to add a mount point. In the dialog "
"window that opens, choose a mount point such as <filename class="
"\"directory\">/</filename> or <filename class=\"directory\">/home</"
"filename>, and the desired capacity for the mount point (such as "
"<literal>10GB</literal> or <literal>500MB</literal>). Note that specifying "
"the mount point is mandatory, but you do not have to specify the capacity at "
"this point; this is useful when adding a mount point which you want to make "
"larger than the current available space permits. Then, click <guilabel>Add "
"mount point</guilabel> to add it to the list using the default settings, "
"which means it will be created as a logical volume, and a new volume group "
"will be created for it unless one already exists."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then, select the newly created mount point in the list on the left side. A "
"set of controls will display on the right side of the screen, allowing you "
"to change its mount point, the device on which it will physically reside, "
"its capacity, file system, etc. When you change any settings, press "
"<guilabel>Update Settings</guilabel> on the bottom right. This will save the "
"adjusted configuration; you can now create another mount point, or select a "
"different existing one and adjust its settings as well."
