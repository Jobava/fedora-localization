msgid "Creating a Btrfs Layout"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<firstterm>Btrfs</firstterm> is a type of file system, but it has several "
"features characteristic of a storage device. It is designed to make the file "
"system tolerant of errors, and to facilitate the detection and repair of "
"errors when they occur. It uses checksums to ensure the validity of data and "
"metadata, and maintains snapshots of the file system that can be used for "
"backup or repair."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Creating a Btrfs layout is somewhat similar to LVM (described in <xref "
"linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-manual-partitioning-lvm\" />) with slightly "
"different terminology. A Btrfs <firstterm>volume</firstterm> is the "
"equivalent of an LVM volume group, and a Btrfs <firstterm>subvolume</"
"firstterm> is similar to a LVM logical volume. An important difference to "
"note is how <application>Anaconda</application> reports sizes for separate "
"mount points: For LVM, the exact size of each logical volume is shown next "
"to each mount point in the left pane, while with Btrfs, the total size of "
"the entire volume is shown next to each subvolume."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some partition types - notably the <filename class=\"directory\">/boot</"
"filename> and <filename class=\"directory\">/usr</filename> directories and "
"the BIOS Boot and EFI partitions - can not be placed on Btrfs subvolumes. "
"Use standard physical volumes for them (or an LVM logical volume for "
"<filename class=\"directory\">/usr</filename>). See <xref linkend=\"sect-"
"installation-gui-manual-partitioning-recommended\" /> for more information."

msgid "Creating Btrfs Subvolumes and Volumes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Click the <guilabel>+</guilabel> button at the bottom of the list showing "
"existing mount points. A new dialog window will open."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the new dialog window, specify a mount point for which you want to create "
"a separate logical volume - for example, <filename class=\"directory\">/</"
"filename>. Optionally, specify a size for the volume using standard units "
"such as MB or GB (for example, <literal>50GB</literal>). Then, click "
"<guilabel>Add mount point</guilabel> to add the volume and return to the "
"main partitioning screen."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When creating a mount point for swap on Btrfs, specify the mount point as "
"<literal>swap</literal>."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The mount point has now been created using the default settings, which means "
"it has been created as an LVM logical volume. Select the newly created mount "
"point in the left pane to configure it further, and convert it to a Btrfs "
"subvolume by changing the <guilabel>Device Type</guilabel> option to "
"<guilabel>Btrfs</guilabel>. Then, click <guilabel>Update Settings</guilabel> "
"in the bottom right corner of the screen."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the <guilabel>Volume</guilabel> menu, you can see that the subvolume has "
"been assigned to an automatically created volume, which is named after the "
"&PRODUCT; variant you are installing (for example, <literal>fedora-server00</"
"literal>. Click the <guilabel>Modify</guilabel> button under the drop-down "
"menu to access the volume settings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the <guilabel>Configure Volume</guilabel> dialog, you can change the "
"volume's name, its <guilabel>RAID level</guilabel> (see <xref linkend=\"sect-"
"installation-gui-manual-partitioning-filesystems\" /> for information about "
"available RAID types), and you can also specify which physical devices "
"(disks) this volume should reside on. You can select one or more disks which "
"will be used to hold this volume by holding down <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> and "
"clicking each disk in the list."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you select a redundant RAID type (such as <guilabel>RAID1 (Redundancy)</"
"guilabel>), the volume will take up twice its actual size on your disks. A 5 "
"GB volume with RAID1 will take up 10 GB of space."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also make sure that the volume is encrypted by selecting the "
"<guilabel>Encrypt</guilabel> option; this will enable LUKS encryption for "
"the entire volume. See the <citetitle>&PRODUCT; Security Guide</citetitle>, "
"available at <ulink url=\"http://docs.fedoraproject.org/\" />, for "
"information about LUKS disk encryption."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Additionally, you can set a fixed size for the volume by selecting the "
"<guilabel>Fixed</guilabel> option from the <guilabel>Size policy</guilabel> "
"menu and entering a size for the volume group."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After you finish configuring the Btrfs volume settings, click "
"<guilabel>Save</guilabel> to return to the main <guilabel>Manual "
"Partitioning</guilabel> screen."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you need to create more than one Btrfs volume, open the <guilabel>Volume</"
"guilabel> drop-down menu and select the <guilabel>Create a new volume group</"
"guilabel> option. A new dialog window will open, identical to the one "
"described in the previous step. Again, select a name, storage devices, "
"encryption settings, RAID level and size policy for the new volume, and "
"click <guilabel>Save</guilabel>. The new volume will then become available "
"in the <guilabel>Volume Group</guilabel> drop-down menu; you can then go "
"through your existing mount points and change this setting to assign them to "
"a different volume."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Configure other settings specific to the subvolume - its <guilabel>Mount "
"Point</guilabel>, <guilabel>Desired Capacity</guilabel>, <guilabel>File "
"System</guilabel>, and <guilabel>Name</guilabel>. Press <guilabel>Update "
"Settings</guilabel> to apply any changes to the configuration."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Repeat this procedure for any additional Btrfs subvolumes you want to create."
" Note that when creating additional subvolumes, a new volume is not "
"automatically created each time; instead, any additional subvolumes are "
"assigned to an existing volume."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For each mount point you create, review its settings and make sure that it "
"is assigned to the correct volume, that it has sufficient capacity, and that "
