msgid "Creating a Logical Volume Managament (LVM) Layout"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<firstterm>Logical Volume Management</firstterm> (LVM) presents a simple "
"logical view of underlying physical storage space, such as hard drives or "
"LUNs. Partitions on physical storage are represented as <firstterm>physical "
"volumes</firstterm> that can be grouped together into <firstterm>volume "
"groups</firstterm>. Each volume group can be divided into multiple "
"<firstterm>logical volumes</firstterm>, each of which is analogous to a "
"standard disk partition. Therefore, LVM logical volumes function as "
"partitions which can span multiple physical disks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See <xref linkend=\"appe-lvm-overview\" /> for additional information about "
"the concepts behind Logical Volume Management."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some partition types - notably the <filename class=\"directory\">/boot</"
"filename> directory and the BIOS Boot and EFI partitions - can not be placed "
"on logical volumes. Use standard physical volumes for them. See <xref "
"linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-manual-partitioning-recommended\" /> for "
"more information."

msgid "Create LVM Logical Volume"

msgid ""
"Follow the procedure below to create LVM logical volumes and volume groups."

msgid "Creating LVM Logical Volumes and Groups"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Click the <guilabel>+</guilabel> button at the bottom of the list showing "
"existing mount points. A new dialog window will open."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the new dialog window, specify a mount point for which you want to create "
"a separate logical volume - for example, <filename class=\"directory\">/</"
"filename>. Optionally, specify a size for the volume using standard units "
"such as MB or GB (for example, <literal>50GB</literal>). Then, click "
"<guilabel>Add mount point</guilabel> to add the volume and return to the "
"main partitioning screen."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When creating a mount point for swap on LVM, specify the mount point as "
"<literal>swap</literal>."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The mount point has now been created using the default settings, which means "
"it has been created as an LVM logical volume, and a volume group has been "
"created to contain it. Select the newly created mount point in the left pane "
"to configure it further. If you want to use thin provisioning for this "
"volume, change the <guilabel>Device Type</guilabel> option to <guilabel>LVM "
"Thin Provisioning</guilabel>."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the <guilabel>Volume Group</guilabel> menu, you can see that the volume "
"has been assigned to an automatically created volume group, which is named "
"after the &PRODUCT; variant you are installing (for example, <literal>fedora-"
"server</literal>. Click the <guilabel>Modify</guilabel> button under the "
"drop-down menu to access the volume group settings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the <guilabel>Configure Volume Group</guilabel> dialog, you can change "
"the volume group's name, its <guilabel>RAID level</guilabel> (see <xref "
"linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-manual-partitioning-filesystems\" /> for "
"information about available RAID types), and you can also specify which "
"physical devices (disks) this volume group should reside on. You can select "
"one or more disks which will be used to hold this volume group by holding "
"down <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> and clicking each disk in the list."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you select a redundant RAID type (such as <guilabel>RAID1 (Redundancy)</"
"guilabel>), the volume group will take up twice its actual size on your "
"disks. A 5 GB volume group with RAID1 will take up 10 GB of space."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also make sure that the volume group is encrypted by selecting the "
"<guilabel>Encrypt</guilabel> option; this will enable LUKS encryption for "
"the entire volume group. See the <citetitle>&PRODUCT; Security Guide</"
"citetitle>, available at <ulink url=\"http://docs.fedoraproject.org/\" />, "
"for information about LUKS disk encryption."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Additionally, you can set a fixed size for the volume group by selecting the "
"<guilabel>Fixed</guilabel> option from the <guilabel>Size policy</guilabel> "
"menu and entering a size for the volume group."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After you finish configuring the volume group settings, click "
"<guilabel>Save</guilabel> to return to the main <guilabel>Manual "
"Partitioning</guilabel> screen."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The configuration dialog does not allow you to specify the size of the "
"volume group's <firstterm>physical extents</firstterm>. The size will always "
"be set to the default value of 4 MiB. If you want to create a volume group "
"with different physical extents, create it manually by switching to an "
"interactive shell and using the <command>vgcreate</command> command, or use "
"a Kickstart file with the <command>volgroup --pesize=<replaceable>size</"
"replaceable></command> command."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you need to create more than one volume group, open the <guilabel>Volume "
"Group</guilabel> drop-down menu and select the <guilabel>Create a new volume "
"group</guilabel> option. A new dialog window will open, identical to the one "
"described in the previous step. Again, select a name, storage devices, "
"encryption settings, RAID level and size policy for the new group, and click "
"<guilabel>Save</guilabel>. The new volume group will then become available "
"in the <guilabel>Volume Group</guilabel> drop-down menu; you can then go "
"through your existing mount points and change this setting to assign them to "
"a different volume group."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Configure other settings specific to the logical volume - its "
"<guilabel>Mount Point</guilabel>, <guilabel>Desired Capacity</guilabel>, "
"<guilabel>File System</guilabel>, and <guilabel>Name</guilabel>. Press "
"<guilabel>Update Settings</guilabel> to apply any changes to the "
"configuration."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Repeat this procedure for any additional logical volumes you want to create. "
"Note that when creating additional LVM logical volumes, a new volume group "
"is not automatically created each time; instead, any additional volumes are "
"assigned to an existing group."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For each mount point you create, review its settings and make sure that it "
"is assigned to the correct group, that it has sufficient capacity, and that "
"it has a descriptive name so you can identify the volume later if you need "
"to."
