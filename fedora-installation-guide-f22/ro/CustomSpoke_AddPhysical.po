msgid "Creating Standard Partitions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<firstterm>Standard partitions</firstterm> are the most common type of "
"partition, with the widest support across operating systems. For example, "
"Microsoft Windows uses exclusively physical partitions and can not natively "
"work with LVM or Btrfs. Most &PRODUCT; partitioning setups will also require "
"at least one standard partition for the <filename class=\"directory\">/boot</"
"filename> directory, and possibly also another standard partition with the "
"BIOS Boot or EFI System file system to store the boot loader."

"Follow the procedure below to create mount points on standard physical "
"partitions:"

msgid ""
"Click the <guilabel>+</guilabel> button at the bottom of the list showing "
"existing mount points. A new dialog window will open."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the new dialog window, specify a mount point for which you want to create "
"a separate mount point - for example, <filename class=\"directory\">/</"
"filename>. Optionally, specify a size for the partition using standard units "
"such as MB or GB (for example, <literal>50GB</literal>). Then, click "
"<guilabel>Add mount point</guilabel> to add the mount point and return to "
"the main partitioning screen."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When creating a swap partition, specify the mount point as <literal>swap</"
"literal>. For a BIOS Boot partition, use <literal>biosboot</literal>. For an "
"EFI System Partition, use <literal>/boot/efi</literal>."

"The mount point has now been created using the default settings, which means "
"it has been created as an LVM logical volume. Select the newly created mount "
"point in the left pane to configure it further, and convert it to a physical "
"partition by changing the <guilabel>Device Type</guilabel> option to "
"<guilabel>Standard Partition</guilabel>. Then, click <guilabel>Update "
"Settings</guilabel> in the bottom right corner of the screen."

"drive this partition will be created."

msgid ""
"In the <guilabel>Configure Mount Point</guilabel> dialog, you can specify "
"which physical devices (disks) this volume <emphasis>may</emphasis> reside "
"on. You can select one or more disks which will be used to hold this volume "
"by holding down <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> and clicking each disk in the list. If "
"you select multiple disks here, <application>Anaconda</application> will "
"determine where exactly the partition should be created based on how you "
"configured the rest of the installation. If you want to make sure that this "
"partition is placed on a specific hard drive, select only that drive and "
"unselect all others."
