msgid "Device, File System and RAID Types"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"&PRODUCT; supports multiple types of devices and file systems. The lists "
"below offer a short description of each available device, file system and "
"RAID type and notes on their usage."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To select a device type or a file system of a partition or a logical volume, "
"select it in the list in <xref linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-manual-"
"partitioning\" /> and select a <guilabel>Device Type</guilabel> and a "
"<guilabel>File System</guilabel> from their respective drop-down menus on "
"the right side of the screen. Then, click <guilabel>Update Settings</"
"guilabel> and repeat this process for all mount points you want to modify."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To configure software RAID, make sure that you have enough physical hard "
"drives selected as installation targets (the number of separate drives "
"required for each type of RAID is noted in its description). Then, choose a "
"RAID level when creating or modifying a Btrfs volume or LVM volume group, or "
"select <guilabel>Software RAID</guilabel> as the device type to create "
"software RAID with standard partitions. For detailed instructions, see <xref "
"linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-manual-partitioning-btrfs\" />, <xref "
"linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-manual-partitioning-lvm\" />, and <xref "
"linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-manual-partitioning-swraid\" /> as needed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Device Types"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<guilabel>Standard Partition</guilabel> - A standard partition can contain a "
"file system or swap space. Standard partitions are most commonly used for "
"<filename class=\"directory\">/boot</filename> and the BIOS Boot and EFI "
"System partitions. LVM logical volumes or Btrfs subvolumes are recommended "
"for most other uses. See <xref linkend=\"appe-disk-partitions-overview\" /> "
"for additional information about the concepts behind physical partitions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<guilabel>LVM</guilabel> - Choosing <guilabel>LVM</guilabel> as the "
"<guilabel>Device Type</guilabel> creates an LVM logical volume and a volume "
"group to contain it (unless one already exists, in which case the new volume "
"is assigned to the existing group). LVM can improve performance when using "
"physical disks and allows you to use multiple disks for a single mount point."
" For information on how to create a logical volume, see <xref linkend=\"sect-"
"installation-gui-manual-partitioning-lvm\" />. Also see <xref linkend=\"appe-"
"lvm-overview\" /> for some additional information about LVM in general."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<guilabel>LVM Thin Provisioning</guilabel> - Using thin provisioning, you "
"can manage a storage pool of free space, known as a <firstterm>thin pool</"
"firstterm>, which can be allocated to an arbitrary number of devices when "
"needed by applications. The thin pool can be expanded dynamically when "
"needed for cost-effective allocation of storage space."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<guilabel>RAID</guilabel> - Creating two or more software RAID partitions "
"allows you to create a software RAID device. One RAID partition is assigned "
"to each disk on the system. See <xref linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-manual-"
"partitioning-swraid\" /> for instructions on creating software RAID."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<guilabel>BTRFS</guilabel> - Btrfs is a file system with several device-like "
"features. It is capable of addressing and managing more files, larger files, "
"and larger volumes than the ext2, ext3, and ext4 file systems. See <xref "
"linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-manual-partitioning-btrfs\" /> for more "
"information about creating Btrfs volumes."
msgstr ""

msgid "File Systems"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<guilabel>ext4</guilabel> - The ext4 file system is based on the ext3 file "
"system and features a number of improvements. These include support for "
"larger file systems and larger files, faster and more efficient allocation "
"of disk space, no limit on the number of subdirectories within a directory, "
"faster file system checking, and more robust journaling. Ext4 is the default "
"and recommended file system used by &PRODUCT; Workstation and Cloud. The "
"maximum supported size of a single ext4 file system is 50 TB."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<guilabel>ext3</guilabel> - The ext3 file system is based on the ext2 file "
"system and has one main advantage - journaling. Using a journaling file "
"system reduces time spent recovering a file system after a crash, as there "
"is no need to check the file system for metadata consistency by running the "
"<command>fsck</command> utility every time a crash occurs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<guilabel>ext2</guilabel> - An ext2 file system supports standard Unix file "
"types, including regular files, directories, or symbolic links. It provides "
"the ability to assign long file names, up to 255 characters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<guilabel>swap</guilabel> - Swap partitions are used to support virtual "
"memory. In other words, data is written to a swap partition when there is "
"not enough RAM to store the data your system is processing. A swap partition "
"should always be created; see <xref linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-manual-"
"partitioning-recommended\" /> for details such as the recommended size."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<guilabel>xfs</guilabel> - XFS is a highly scalable, high-performance file "
"system that supports file systems up to 16 exabytes (approximately 16 "
"million terabytes), files up to 8 exabytes (approximately 8 million "
"terabytes), and directory structures containing tens of millions of entries. "
"XFS also supports metadata journaling, which facilitates quicker crash "
"recovery. The maximum supported size of a single XFS file system is 500 TB. "
"Starting with &PRODUCT;&nbsp;22, XFS is the default and recommended file "
"system on &PRODUCT; Server."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the size of an XFS file system can not currently be reduced "
"without destroying and recreating the file system. If you expect that you "
"will need to adjust the sizes of your file systems often, using XFS is not "
"recommended, as it makes administration substantially more time-consuming."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<guilabel>vfat</guilabel> - The VFAT file system is a Linux file system that "
"is compatible with Microsoft Windows long file names on the FAT file system."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<guilabel>BIOS Boot</guilabel> - A very small partition required for booting "
"from a device with a GUID partition table (GPT) on BIOS systems and UEFI "
"systems in BIOS compatibility mode. See <xref linkend=\"sect-installation-"
"gui-manual-partitioning-recommended\" /> for details."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<guilabel>EFI System Partition</guilabel> - A small partition required for "
"booting a device with a GUID partition table (GPT) on a UEFI system. See "
"<xref linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-manual-partitioning-recommended\" /> "
"for details."
msgstr ""

msgid "Software RAID Types"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<guilabel>RAID0 (Performance)</guilabel> - Distributes data across multiple "
"disks. Level 0 RAID offers increased performance over standard partitions "
"and can be used to pool the storage of multiple disks into one large virtual "
"device. Note that Level 0 RAIDs offer no redundancy and that the failure of "
"one device in the array destroys data in the entire array. RAID 0 requires "
"at least two disks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<guilabel>RAID1 (Redundancy)</guilabel> - Mirrors all data from one "
"partition onto one or more other disks. Additional devices in the array "
"provide increasing levels of redundancy. RAID 1 requires at least two disks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<guilabel>RAID4 (Error Checking)</guilabel> - Distributes data across "
"multiple disks and uses one disk in the array to store parity information "
"which safeguards the array in case any disk within the array fails. Because "
"all parity information is stored on one disk, access to this disk creates a "
"\"bottleneck\" in the array's performance. Level 4 RAID requires at least "
"three disks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<guilabel>RAID5 (Distributed Error Checking)</guilabel> - Distributes data "
"and parity information across multiple disks. Level 5 RAIDs therefore offer "
"the performance advantages of distributing data across multiple disks, but "
"do not share the performance bottleneck of level 4 RAIDs because the parity "
"information is also distributed through the array. RAID 5 requires at least "
"three disks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<guilabel>RAID6 (Redundant Error Checking)</guilabel> - Level 6 RAIDs are "
"similar to level 5 RAIDs, but instead of storing only one set of parity "
"data, they store two sets. RAID 6 requires at least four disks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<guilabel>RAID10 (Performance, Redundancy)</guilabel> - Level 10 RAIDs are "
"nested RAIDs or hybrid RAIDs. They are constructed by distributing data over "
"mirrored sets of disks. For example, a level 10 RAID array constructed from "
"four RAID partitions consists of two mirrored pairs of striped partitions. "
"RAID 10 requires at least four disks."
