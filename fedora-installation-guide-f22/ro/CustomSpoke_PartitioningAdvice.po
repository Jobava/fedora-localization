msgid "Advice on Partitions"

msgid ""
"There is no best way to partition every system; the optimal setup depends on "
"how you plan to use the system being installed. However, the following tips "
"may help you find the optimal layout for your needs:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Consider encrypting any partitions and volumes which might contain sensitive "
"data. Encryption prevents unauthorized people from accessing the data on the "
"partitions, even if they have access to the physical storage device. In most "
"cases, you should at least encrypt the <filename class=\"directory\">/home</"
"filename> partition, which contains user data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In some cases, creating separate mount points for directories other than "
"<filename class=\"directory\">/</filename>, <filename class=\"directory\">/"
"boot</filename> and <filename class=\"directory\">/home</filename> may be "
"useful; for example, on a server running a <application>MySQL</application> "
"database, having a separate mount point for <filename class=\"directory\">/"
"var/lib/mysql</filename> will allow you to preserve the database during a "
"reinstallation without having to restore it from backup afterwards. However, "
"having unnecessary separate mount points will make storage administration "
"more difficult."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some special restrictions apply to certain directories with regards on which "
"partitioning layouts can they be placed. Notably, the <filename class="
"\"directory\">/boot</filename> directory must always be on a physical "
"partition (not on an LVM volume or a Btrfs subvolume), and <filename class="
"\"directory\">/usr</filename> can not be on a Btrfs subvolume."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are new to Linux, consider reviewing the <citetitle>Linux Filesystem "
"Hierarchy Standard</citetitle> at <ulink url=\"http://refspecs."
"linuxfoundation.org/FHS_2.3/fhs-2.3.html\" /> for information about various "
"system directories and their contents."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each kernel installed on your system requires approximately 20 MB on the "
"<filename class=\"directory\">/boot</filename> partition. The default "
"partition size of 500 MB for <filename class=\"directory\">/boot</filename> "
"should suffice for most common uses; increase the size of this partition if "
"you plan to keep many kernels installed at the same time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The <filename class=\"directory\">/var</filename> directory holds content "
"for a number of applications, including the <application>Apache</"
"application> web server, and is used by the <application>DNF</application> "
"package manager to temporarily store downloaded package updates. Make sure "
"that the partition or volume containing <filename class=\"directory\">/var</"
"filename> has at least 3 GB."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The contents of the <filename class=\"directory\">/var</filename> directory "
"usually change very often. This may cause problems with older solid state "
"drives (SSDs), as they can handle a lower number of read/write cycles before "
"becoming unusable. If your system root is on an SSD, consider creating a "
"separate mount point for <filename class=\"directory\">/var</filename> on a "
"classic (platter) HDD."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The <filename class=\"directory\">/usr</filename> directory holds the "
"majority of software on a typical &PRODUCT; installation. The partition or "
"volume containing this directory should therefore be at least 5 GB for "
"minimal installations, and at least 10 GB for installations with a graphical "
"environment."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Consider leaving a portion of the space in an LVM volume group unallocated. "
"This unallocated space gives you flexibility if your space requirements "
"change but you do not wish to remove data from other volumes. You can also "
"select the <guilabel>Thin provisioning</guilabel> device type for the "
"partition to have the unused space handled automatically by the volume."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The size of an <systemitem>XFS</systemitem> file system can not be reduced - "
"if you need to make a partition or volume with this file system smaller, you "
"must back up your data, destroy the file system, and create a new, smaller "
"one in its place. Therefore, if you expect needing to manipulate your "
"partitioning layout later, you should use the <systemitem>ext4</systemitem> "
"file system instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use Logical Volume Management (LVM) if you anticipate expanding your storage "
"by adding more hard drives after the installation. With LVM, you can create "
"physical volumes on the new drives, and then assign them to any volume group "
"and logical volume as you see fit - for example, you can easily expand your "
"system's <filename class=\"directory\">/home</filename> (or any other "
"directory residing on a logical volume)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Creating a BIOS Boot partition or an EFI System Partition may be necessary, "
"depending on your system's firmware, boot drive size, and boot drive disk "
"label. See <xref linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-manual-partitioning-"
"recommended\" /> for information about these partitions. Note that the "
"graphical installer will not let you create a BIOS Boot or EFI System "
"Partition if your system does <emphasis>not</emphasis> require one - in that "
"case, they will be hidden from the menu."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you need to make any changes to your storage configuration after the "
"installation, &PRODUCT; repositories offer several different tools which can "
"help you do this. If you prefer a command line tool, try <package>system-"
"storage-manager</package>."
