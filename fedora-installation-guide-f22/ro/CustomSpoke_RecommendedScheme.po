msgid ""
"In most cases, at least the following mount points should always be created:"
msgstr ""

msgid "<filename class=\"directory\">/boot</filename> - 500 MB"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This partition contains the operating system kernel, which allows &PRODUCT; "
"to boot. It also contains other files used during the bootstrap process. Due "
"to the limitations of most firmware, creating a separate, small standard "
"partition for this directory is recommended. In most scenarios, a 500 MB "
"<filename class=\"directory\">/boot</filename> partition is adequate."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If your system has a hardware RAID controller, be aware that some BIOS types "
"do not support booting from it. In that case, the <filename class="
"\"directory\">/boot</filename> partition must be created on a partition "
"outside of the RAID array, such as on a separate hard drive."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Also note that the <filename class=\"directory\">/boot</filename> directory "
"can not be placed on a LVM logical volume or a Btrfs subvolume. Use a "
"standard partition."
msgstr ""

msgid "<filename class=\"directory\">/</filename> (root) - 10 GB"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is where the root directory is located. The root directory is the top "
"level of the directory structure. By default, all files are written to this "
"partition unless a different partition is mounted in the path being written "
"to (for example, <filename class=\"directory\">/boot</filename> or <filename "
"class=\"directory\">/home</filename>). If you follow the recommended scheme "
"described in this section, this will be the partition where most software "
"packages will be installed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For a minimal installation, a 5 GB root partition will be sufficient. "
"However, for most common installations which include extra packages and a "
"graphical user interface, the root partition should be at least 10 GB; with "
"20 GB being sufficient for most common use cases."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The <filename class=\"directory\">/</filename> mount point is the top of the "
"Linux Filesystem Hierarchy, and is referred to as the <firstterm>root file "
"system</firstterm>, or root. The <filename class=\"directory\">/root</"
"filename> directory, sometimes pronounced \"<firstterm>slash-root</"
"firstterm>\", is the home directory for the <systemitem class="
"\"username\">root</systemitem> user."
msgstr ""

msgid "<filename class=\"directory\">/home</filename> - at least 10 GB"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To store user data separately from system data, create a dedicated mount "
"point for the <filename>/home</filename> directory. This partition should be "
"sized based on the amount of data that will be stored locally, number of "
"users, and so on. This will allow you to upgrade or reinstall &PRODUCT; "
"without erasing user data files. During the installation, a separate "
"<filename class=\"directory\">/home</filename> partition will be created if "
"there are 50 GB or more free space for your &PRODUCT; installation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using &PRODUCT; as a workstation for normal use with a graphical "
"environment, this mount point should have the most disk space assigned to "
"it, as it will likely hold the most data (user settings, images, videos, "
"etc)."
msgstr ""

msgid "swap - based on your system parameters"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Swap partitions support virtual memory; data is written to them when there "
"is not enough RAM to store the data your system is processing. This "
"partition's size is a function of system memory workload, not total system "
"memory, and therefore is not equal to the total system memory size. "
"Therefore, it is important to analyze what applications a system will be "
"running and the load those applications will serve in order to determine the "
"system memory workload. Application providers and developers should be able "
"to provide some guidance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the system runs out of swap space, the kernel terminates processes as "
"the system RAM memory is exhausted. Configuring too much swap space results "
"in storage devices being allocated but idle and is a poor use of resources. "
"Too much swap space can also hide memory leaks. The maximum size for a swap "
"partition and other additional information can be found in the "
"<systemitem>mkswap(8)</systemitem> man page."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The table below provides the recommended size of a swap partition depending "
"on the amount of RAM in your system and whether you want sufficient memory "
"for your system to hibernate. If you let the installation program partition "
"your system automatically, the swap partition size will be established using "
"these guidelines. Automatic partitioning setup assumes hibernation is not in "
"use, and the maximum size of the swap partition is limited to 10% of the "
"total size of the hard drive. If you want to set up enough swap space to "
"allow for hibernation, or if you want to set the swap partition size to more "
"than 10% of the system's storage space, you must edit the partitioning "
"layout manually."
