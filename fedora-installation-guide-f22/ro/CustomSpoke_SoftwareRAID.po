"<firstterm>Redundant arrays of independent disks</firstterm> (RAIDs) are "
"constructed from multiple storage devices that are arranged to provide "
"increased performance and, in some configurations, greater fault tolerance. "
"See <xref linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-manual-partitioning-filesystems\" /"
"> a description of different kinds of RAIDs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A RAID device is created in one step, and disks are added or removed as "
"necessary. One RAID partition per physical disk is allowed for each device, "
"so the number of disks available to the installation program determines "
"which levels of RAID device are available to you. For example, if your "
"system has two hard drives, the installation program will not allow you to "
"create a RAID10 device, which requires 4 separate partitions."

msgid ""
"This section only explains how to create software RAID with standard "
"(physical) partitions. However, you can also configure LVM volume groups and "
"Btrfs volumes to use RAID and place their logical volumes or Btrfs "
"subvolumes on top of this RAID array. See <xref linkend=\"sect-installation-"
"gui-manual-partitioning-lvm\" /> and <xref linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-"
"manual-partitioning-btrfs\" /> for instructions on creating RAID in LVM and "
"Btrfs."
