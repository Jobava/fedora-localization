"This part of the <guilabel>Installation Destination</guilabel> screen allows "
"you to configure non-local storage devices, namely iSCSI and FCoE storage. "
"This section will mostly be useful to advanced users who have a need for "
"networked disks. For instructions on setting up local hard drives, see <xref "
"linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-storage-partitioning\" />."

msgid ""
"This section only explains how to make existing network disks available "
"inside the installer. It does not explain how to set up your network or a "
"storage server, only how to connect to them."

msgid ""
"The screen contains a list of all currently available (discovered) network "
"storage devices. When the screen is opened for the first time, the list will "
"be empty in most cases because no network storage has been discovered - the "
"installer makes no attempt at discovering this unless you configure network "
"disks using a Kickstart file."

msgid ""
"To add one or more storage devices to the screen so you can search them and "
"use them in the installation, click <guilabel>Add iSCSI Target</guilabel> or "
"<guilabel>Add FCoE SAN</guilabel> in the bottom right corner of the screen, "
"and follow the instructions in <xref linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-"
"installation-destination-add-iscsi\" /> or <xref linkend=\"sect-installation-"
"gui-installation-destination-add-fcoe\" />, depending on which type of "
"network storage you want to add."

"Network storage devices successfully discovered and configured by the "
"installer will then be displayed in the main list, along with identifying "
"information such as <guilabel>Name</guilabel>, <guilabel>WWID</guilabel>, "

"On lower display resolutions, the list may be too wide to fit on the screen, "

"Depending on the tab you are currently in, you can filter the discovered "

"filtering options are automatically populated based on discovered devices "
"(for example, if you select <guilabel>Filter By:</guilabel> "
"<guilabel>Vendor</guilabel>, another drop-down menu will appear showing all "

"In the list (regardless of how it is filtered), each device is presented on "
