msgid "Add iSCSI Target"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To use iSCSI storage devices, the installer must be able to discover them as "
"<firstterm>iSCSI targets</firstterm> and be able to create an iSCSI session "
"to access them. Both of these steps may require a user name and password for "
"<firstterm>Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol</firstterm> (CHAP) "
"authentication."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also configure an iSCSI target to authenticate the iSCSI initiator "
"on the system to which the target is attached (<firstterm>reverse CHAP</"
"firstterm>), both for discovery and for the session. Used together, CHAP and "
"reverse CHAP are called <firstterm>mutual CHAP</firstterm> or <firstterm>two-"
"way CHAP</firstterm>. Mutual CHAP provides the greatest level of security "
"for iSCSI connections, particularly if the user name and password are "
"different for CHAP authentication and reverse CHAP authentication."
