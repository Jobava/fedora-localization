msgid "Installing Using Anaconda"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This chapter provides step-by-step instructions for installing &PRODUCT; "
"using the <application>Anaconda</application> installer. The bulk of this "
"chapter describes installation using the graphical user interface. A text "
"mode is also available for systems with no graphical display, but this mode "
"is limited in certain aspects (for example, custom partitioning is not "
"possible in text mode)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If your system does not have the ability to use the graphical mode, you can:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use Kickstart to automate the installation as described in <xref linkend="
"\"chap-kickstart-installations\" />"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Perform the graphical installation remotely by connecting to the "
"installation system from another computer with a graphical display using the "
"<firstterm>VNC</firstterm> (Virtual Network Computing) protocol - see <xref "
"linkend=\"chap-vnc-installations\" />"
msgstr ""

msgid "Introduction to Anaconda"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The &PRODUCT; installer, <application>Anaconda</application>, is different "
"from most other operating system installation programs due to its parallel "
"nature. Most installers follow a fixed path: you must choose your language "
"first, then you configure network, then installation type, then "
"partitioning, etc. There is usually only one way to proceed at any given "
"time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In <application>Anaconda</application> you are only required to select your "
"language and locale first, and then you are presented with a central screen, "
"where you can configure most aspects of the installation in any order you "
"like. This does not apply to all parts of the installation process, however -"
" for example, when installing from a network location, you must configure "
"the network before you can select which packages to install."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some screens will be automatically configured depending on your hardware and "
"the type of media you used to start the installation. You can still change "
"the detected settings in any screen. Screens which have not been "
"automatically configured, and therefore require your attention before you "
"begin the installation, are marked by an exclamation mark. You can not start "
"the actual installation process before you finish configuring these settings."
""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Additional differences appear in certain screens; notably the custom "
"partitioning process is very different from other Linux distributions. These "
"differences are described in each screen's subsection."
msgstr ""

msgid "Consoles and Logging During the Installation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following sections describe how to access logs and an interactive shell "
"during the installation. This is useful when troubleshooting problems, but "
"should not be necessary in most cases."
msgstr ""

msgid "Accessing Consoles"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The &PRODUCT; installer uses the <application>tmux</application> terminal "
"multiplexer to display and control several windows you can use in addition "
"to the main interface. Each of these windows serves a different purpose - "
"they display several different logs, which can be used to troubleshoot any "
"issues during the installation, and one of the windows provides an "
"interactive shell prompt with <systemitem class=\"username\">root</"
"systemitem> privileges, unless this prompt was specifically disabled using a "
"boot option or a Kickstart command."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In general, there is no reason to leave the default graphical installation "
"environment unless you need to diagnose an installation problem."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The terminal multiplexer is running in virtual console 1. To switch from the "
"actual installation environment to <application>tmux</application>, press "
"<keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F1</keycap></"
"keycombo>. To go back to the main installation interface which runs in "
"virtual console 6, press <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</"
"keycap><keycap>F6</keycap></keycombo>."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you choose text mode installation, you will start in virtual console 1 "
"(<application>tmux</application>), and switching to console 6 will open a "
"shell prompt instead of a graphical interface."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The console running <application>tmux</application> has 5 available windows; "
"their contents are described in the table below, along with keyboard "
"shortcuts used to access them. Note that the keyboard shortcuts are two-part:"

"then release both keys, and press the number key for the window you want to "

msgid "Text Mode Installation"

msgid "Installing in the Graphical User Interface"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The graphical installation interface is the preferred method of manually "
"installing &PRODUCT;. It allows you full control over all available "
"settings, including custom partitioning and advanced storage configuration, "
