"<application>Kdump</application> is a kernel crash dumping mechanism which, "
"in the event of a system crash, captures the contents of the system memory "
"at the moment of failure. This captured memory can then be analyzed to find "
"the cause of the crash. If <application>Kdump</application> is enabled, it "
"must have a small portion of the system's memory (RAM) reserved to itself. "
"This reserved memory will not be accessible to the main kernel."

"To enable <application>Kdump</application> on the installed system, check "
"<guilabel>Enabled</guilabel>. Then, select either <guilabel>Automatic</"
"guilabel> or <guilabel>Manual</guilabel> memory reservation settings, and if "
"you selected <guilabel>Manual</guilabel>, enter the amount of memory to be "
"reserved in megabytes into the <guilabel>Memory to be reserved</guilabel> "
"field."

"The amount of memory which you should reserve is determined based on your "
"system's architecture (AMD64 and Intel&nbsp;64 will have different "
"requirements than IBM Power, for example) as well as the total amount of "
"system memory. In most cases, automatic reservation will be satisfactory. If "
