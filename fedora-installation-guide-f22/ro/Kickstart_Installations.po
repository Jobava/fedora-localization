msgid "Automating the Installation with Kickstart"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Kickstart installations offer a means to automate the installation process, "
"either partially or fully. Kickstart files contain answers to all questions "
"normally asked by the installation program, such as what time zone do you "
"want the system to use, how should the drives be partitioned or which "
"packages should be installed. Providing a prepared Kickstart file when the "
"installation begins therefore allows the you to perform the installation "
"automatically, without need for any intervention from the user. This is "
"especially useful when deploying &PRODUCT; on a large number of systems at "
"once."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All Kickstart scripts and the log files of their execution are stored in the "
"<filename>/tmp</filename> directory to assist with debugging installation "
"issues."
msgstr ""

msgid "How to Perform a Kickstart Installation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Kickstart installations can be performed using a local DVD, a local hard "
"drive, or via NFS, FTP, HTTP, or HTTPS."
msgstr ""

msgid "To use Kickstart, you must:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Create a Kickstart file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create boot media or configure a network boot (PXE) server which will be "
"used to begin the installation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make the Kickstart file available on removable media, a hard drive, or a "
"network location."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Start the Kickstart installation by booting the installer and using a boot "
"option to tell the installer where to find the Kickstart file."
msgstr ""

msgid "This chapter explains these steps in detail."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating a Kickstart File"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Kickstart file itself is a plain text file, containing keywords listed "
"in <xref linkend=\"appe-kickstart-syntax-reference\" />, which serve as "
"directions for the installation. Any text editor able to save files as ASCII "
"text (such as <application>Gedit</application> or <application>vim</"
"application> on Linux systems or <application>Notepad</application> on "
"Windows systems) can be used to create and edit Kickstart files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The recommended approach to creating Kickstart files is to perform a manual "
"installation on one system first. After the installation completes, all "
"choices made during the installation are saved into a file named "
"<filename>anaconda-ks.cfg</filename>, located in the <filename class="
"\"directory\">/root/</filename> directory on the installed system. You can "
"then copy this file, make any changes you need, and use the resulting "
"configuration file in further installations."
msgstr ""

msgid "When creating a Kickstart file, keep in mind the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Lines starting with a pound sign (<literal>#</literal>) are treated as "
"comments and are ignored."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sections must be specified <emphasis>in order</emphasis>. Items within the "
"sections do not have to be in a specific order unless otherwise specified. "
"The correct section order is:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The command section which contains actual Kickstart commands and options as "
"listed in <xref linkend=\"appe-kickstart-syntax-reference\" />. Note that "
"some commands, such as <command>install</command>, are mandatory, but most "
"commands are optional."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The <command>%packages</command> section which contains a list of packages "
"and package groups to be installed. See <xref linkend=\"sect-kickstart-"
"packages\" /> for details."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The <command>%pre</command> and <command>%post</command> sections, "
"containing a pre-installation and post-installation scripts. These two "
"sections can be in any order and are not mandatory. See <xref linkend=\"sect-"
"kickstart-preinstall\" /> and <xref linkend=\"sect-kickstart-postinstall\" /"
"> for details."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The <command>%packages</command>, <command>%pre</command> and "
"<command>%post</command> sections must end with <command>%end</command>, "
"otherwise the installation program will refuse the Kickstart file. The main "
"command section has no special ending statement."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Omitting any required item results in the installation program prompting the "
"user for an answer to the related item, just as the user would be prompted "
"during a typical installation. Once the answer is given, the installation "
"will continue. Note that if the system you are installing has no display, "
"you will not be able to see the prompt, and the installation will appear to "
"have failed."

msgid "Verifying the Kickstart File"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When creating or customizing your kickstart file, it is useful to verify "
"that it is valid before attempting to use it in an installation. &PRODUCT; "
"includes the <application>ksvalidator</application> command line utility "
"which can be used to do this. This tool is a part of the "
"<package>pykickstart</package> package. To install this package, execute the "
"following command:"
msgstr ""

msgid "<prompt>#</prompt> <command>dnf install pykickstart</command>"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After installing the package, you can validate a Kickstart file using the "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<prompt>$</prompt> <command>ksvalidator <replaceable>/path/to/kickstart.ks</"
"replaceable></command>"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Replace <replaceable>/path/to/kickstart.ks</replaceable> with the path to "
"the Kickstart file you want to verify."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For more information about this tool, see the <systemitem>ksvalidator(1)</"
"systemitem> man page."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keep in mind that the validation tool has its limitations. The Kickstart "
"file can be very complicated; <application>ksvalidator</application> can "
"make sure the syntax is correct and that the file does not include removed "
"options, but it cannot guarantee the installation will be successful. It "
"also does not attempt to validate the <command>%pre</command>, "
"<command>%post</command> and <command>%packages</command> sections of the "
"Kickstart file."

msgid "Making the Kickstart File Available"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once you create a Kickstart file, you can place it in one of the following "
"locations:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On <emphasis>removable media</emphasis>, such as a DVD or USB flash drive "
"connected to the installation system"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On a <emphasis>hard drive</emphasis> connected to the installation system"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On a <emphasis>network share</emphasis> reachable from the installation "
"system"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Normally, a Kickstart file is copied to removable media or a hard drive, or "
"made available on the network. Placing the file in a network location "
"complements the usual approach to Kickstart installations, which is also "
"network-based: the system is booted using a PXE server, the Kickstart file "
"is downloaded from a network share, and software packages specified in the "
"file are downloaded from remote repositories."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<xref linkend=\"chap-pxe-server-setup\" /> offers some additional "
"information about preparing for a network-based installation."

msgid "Starting the Kickstart Installation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once you have everything ready - you have created a valid Kickstart file and "
"you have either local boot media or a PXE server available, you can start "
"the Kickstart installation. You need to use the <option>inst.ks=</option> "
"boot option either in the boot menu (when booting from local media), or add "
"this option to your PXE server configuration. For information about boot "
"options used in Kickstart installations, see <xref linkend=\"sect-boot-"
