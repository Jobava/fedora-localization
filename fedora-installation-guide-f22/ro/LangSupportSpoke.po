"The <guilabel>Language Support</guilabel> screen allows you to configure "
"language settings for your system. The default language is determined by "
"your selection in <xref linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-welcome\" /> and "
"support for this language can not be removed. You can only add additional "
"languages, which will be available on the installed system - not during the "
"installation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to change the default language, or the language used during the "
"installation, you must reboot your system, start the installer again, and "
"select a different language in <xref linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-"
"welcome\" />."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Adding support for another language does not automatically configure the "
"corresponding keyboard layout. Layouts are a separate setting configured in "
"<xref linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-keyboard-layout\" />."

msgid ""
"The left panel contains a list of available language groups such as "
"<guilabel>English</guilabel> or <guilabel>Bulgarian</guilabel>. If at least "
"one language from a group is selected, a check mark will be displayed next "
"to the group, and the list entry will be highlighted. This allows you to "
"easily see which languages you have configured support for."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To add support for one or more additional languages, click a group in the "
"left panel, and then select one or more regional variations in the right "
"panel using check boxes next to list entries. Repeat this process for all "
"languages you want to install support for."

msgid ""
"Enabling support for some languages (typically languages which use non-Latin "
"script) will install additional packages - for example, enabling support for "
"one or more languages from the <guilabel>Arabic</guilabel> group will also "
"install the <literal>arabic-support</literal> package group. For more "
"information about packages, see <xref linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-"
"software-selection\" />."

"Once you have made your selections, click <guilabel>Done</guilabel> in the "
