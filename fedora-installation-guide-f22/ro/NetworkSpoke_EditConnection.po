msgid "Editing Network Interface Configuration"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This section only details the most important settings for a typical wired "
"connection used during installation. Many of the available options do not "
"have to be changed in most installation scenarios and are not carried over "
"to the installed system. Configuration of other types of networks is broadly "
"similar, although the specific configuration parameters may be different. To "
"learn more about network configuration after installation, see the "
"<citetitle>&PRODUCT; Networking&nbsp;Guide</citetitle>, available at <ulink "
"url=\"http://docs.fedoraproject.org/\" />."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To configure a network connection manually, select that connection in the "
"list on the left side of the screen, and click the <guilabel>Configure</"
"guilabel> button. A dialog will appear that allows you to configure the "
"selected connection. The configuration options presented depends on the "
"connection type - the available options will be slightly different depending "
"on whether it is a physical interface (wired or wireless network interface "
"controller) or a virtual interface (Bond, Team or Vlan) which you previously "
"configured in <xref linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-network-configuration-"
"virtual-interface\" />.. A full description of all configuration settings "
"for all connection types is beyond the scope of this document; see the "
"<citetitle>Networking Guide</citetitle> for details."
msgstr ""

msgid "The most common and useful options in the configuration dialog are:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Enable or disable the connection by default"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the <guilabel>General</guilabel> tab of the configuration dialog, you can "
"select or unselect the <guilabel>Automatically connect to this network when "
"it is available</guilabel> check box to allow or disallow this connection to "
"connect by default. When enabled on a wired connection, this means the "
"system will typically connect during startup (unless you unplug the network "
"cable); on a wireless connection, it means that the interface will attempt "
"to connect to any known wireless networks in range."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Additionally, you can allow or disallow all users on the system from "
"connecting to this network using the <guilabel>All users may connect to this "
"network</guilabel> option. If you disable this option, only <systemitem "
"class=\"username\">root</systemitem> will be able to connect to this network."
""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is not possible to only allow a specific user other than <systemitem "
"class=\"username\">root</systemitem> to use this interface, because no other "
"users are created at this point during the installation. If you need a "
"connection for a different user, you must configure it after the "
"installation."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set up static IPv4 or IPv6 settings"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, both <systemitem class=\"protocol\">IPv4</systemitem> and "
"<systemitem class=\"protocol\">IPv6</systemitem> are set to automatic "
"configuration depending on current network settings. This means that "
"addresses such as the local IP address, DNS address, and other settings will "
"be detected automatically each time the interface connects to a network. In "
"many cases, this is sufficient, but you can also provide static "
"configuration in the <guilabel>IPv4 Settings</guilabel> and <guilabel>IPv6 "
"Settings</guilabel>, respectively."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To set static network configuration, navigate to one of the settings tabs "
"and select a method other than <guilabel>Automatic</guilabel> (for example, "
"<guilabel>Manual</guilabel>) from the <guilabel>Method</guilabel> drop-down "
"menu. This will enable the <guilabel>Addresses</guilabel> field below."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the <guilabel>IPv6 Settings</guilabel> tab, you can also set the method "
"to <guilabel>Ignore</guilabel> to disable <systemitem class="
"\"protocol\">IPv6</systemitem> on this interface."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then, click <guilabel>Add</guilabel> on the right side and add a set of "
"settings: <guilabel>Address</guilabel>, <guilabel>Netmask</guilabel> (for "
"<systemitem class=\"protocol\">IPv4</systemitem>), <guilabel>Prefix</"
"guilabel> (for <systemitem class=\"protocol\">IPv6</systemitem>), and "
"<guilabel>Gateway</guilabel>."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The <guilabel>DNS servers</guilabel> field accepts one or more IP addresses "
"of DNS servers - for example, <literal>10.0.0.1,10.0.0.8</literal>."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The final option in both tabs is <guilabel>Require IPv<replaceable>X</"
"replaceable> addressing for this connection to complete</guilabel>. Select "
"this option in the <systemitem class=\"protocol\">IPv4</systemitem> tab to "
"only allow this connection if <systemitem class=\"protocol\">IPv4</"
"systemitem> was successful; the same principle applies to this setting in "
"the <systemitem class=\"protocol\">IPv6</systemitem> tab. If this option "
"remains disabled for both <systemitem class=\"protocol\">IPv4</systemitem> "
"and <systemitem class=\"protocol\">IPv6</systemitem>, the interface will be "

msgid "Configure routes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the <guilabel>IPv4 Settings</guilabel> and <guilabel>IPv4 Settings</"
"guilabel> tabs, click the <guilabel>Routes</guilabel> button in the bottom "
"right corner to configure routing settings for a specific IP protocol on an "
"interface. A new dialog will open, allowing you to <guilabel>Add</guilabel> "
"a specific route."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you confire at least one static route, you can disallow all routes not "
"specifically configured here by enabling the <guilabel>Ignore automatically "
"obtained routes</guilabel>."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Select <guilabel>Use this connection only for resources on its network</"
"guilabel> to prevent this connection from becoming the default route. This "
"option can be selected even if you did not configure any static routes. "
"Enabling this option means that this route will only be used when necessary "
"to access certain resources, such as intranet pages which require a local or "
"VPN connection. Another (default) route will be used for publicly available "
"resources if possible. Note that unlike the additional routes configured in "
"this dialog, this setting will be transferred to the installed system. Also "
"note that this option is only useful when more than one interface is "
"configured."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you finish configuring the interface's routing settings, click "
"<guilabel>OK</guilabel> to return to the configuration dialog."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
