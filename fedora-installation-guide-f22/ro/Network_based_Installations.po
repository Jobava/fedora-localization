msgid "Setting Up an Installation Server"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This appendix is intended for users with previous Linux experience. If you "
"are a new user, you may want to install using minimal boot media or the "
"distribution DVD instead."
msgstr ""

msgid "PXE Installation Overview"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Preboot Execution Environment, or PXE, is a techonology that allows "
"computers to boot directly from resources provided over the network. "
"Installing Fedora over the network means you don't have to create media, and "
"you can install to multiple computers or virtual machine simultaneously. The "
"process involves a number of components and features working together to "
"provide the resources required."
msgstr ""

msgid "PXE-capable computer"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most modern computers have the capability to network boot. Typically, a "
"function key pressed during boot will bring up a boot selection menu. In "
"environments designed for unattended administration, systems will often be "
"configured to first attempt booting from the network, then boot from local "
"storage, and the installation server is configured to only offer the "
"installation when required. Your computer's manual will provide specific "
"instructions on setting boot priorities."
msgstr ""

msgid "DHCP Server"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a system requests an address during network booting, the DHCP server "
"also provides the location of files to boot. A network should have only one "
"DHCP server."
msgstr ""

msgid "TFTP Server"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because the pre-boot environment is very simple, files must be provided in a "
"very simple way. Trivial File Transfer Protocol, or TFTP, provides the "
"system with the bootloader required to continue the installation process."

msgid "Bootloader"
msgstr "Program de pornire"

msgid ""
"Because the job of booting an operating system is too complex for the pre-"
"boot environment, a bootloader is used to load the kernel and related files. "
"It also provides configuration information to the installer, and can offer a "
"menu to select from different configurations."
msgstr ""

msgid "Kernel and Initramfs"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The kernel is the core of any Linux operating system, and the initramfs "
"provides the kernel with required tools and resources. These files are also "
"provided by tftp."
msgstr ""

msgid "Package repository"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A Fedora repository must be available for the installation. The example in "
"this section uses the public Fedora mirrors as the repository source, but "
"you can also use a repo on the local network provided by NFS, FTP, or HTTP. "
"Repositories can be configured using the <option>inst.repo=</option> boot "
"option; see <xref linkend=\"sect-boot-options-sources\" /> for details."
