msgid ""
"The <guilabel>Root Password</guilabel> screen is used to configure the "
"<systemitem class=\"username\">root</systemitem> password for your system. "
"This password will be used to log into the administrator (also known as "
"superuser) account, which is used for system administration tasks such as "
"installing and updating software packages and changing system-wide "
"configuration such as network and firewall settings, storage options and "
"adding or modifying users, groups and file permissions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The <systemitem class=\"username\">root</systemitem> account will always be "
"created during the installation. However, you should always also create a "
"normal user accont in <xref linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-create-user\" /> "
"and use that account to log in to the system. Only switch to the "
"administrator account only when you need to perform a task which requires "
"administrator access."

msgid ""
"The <systemitem class=\"username\">root</systemitem> account has complete "
"control over the system. If an unauthorized person gains access to this "
"account, access or delete all users' personal files or otherwise exploit the "
"machine for their own nefarious purposes. See the <citetitle>&PRODUCT; "
"Security Guide</citetitle>, available at <ulink url=\"http://docs."

"and guidelines for choosing a strong password."

"Once you choose a strong password, enter it in the <guilabel>Root Password</"
"guilabel> field. The characters you write will be displayed as dots for "
"security. Then, type the same password into the <guilabel>Confirm</guilabel> "
"field to ensure you entered it properly. Both entered passwords must be the "
"same."

msgid ""
"As you enter the password, it will be evaluated and the installer will "
"determine the password's strength. If the installer considers your password "
"weak, a message will appear at the bottom of the screen, explaining which "
"aspect of your chosen password is considered insuficient. For example:"

"password is shorter than 5 characters.</guilabel>\n"

"choose a different, stronger password."

"Once you configure the superuser password, click <guilabel>Done</guilabel> "
"in the top left corner to return to <xref linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-"
