"This chapter describes the steps you need take before you begin the "
"installation. Not every step must be strictly followed - for example, if you "
"plan to use the default installation settings, you do not need to gather "
"system information such as disk device labels/UUIDs or network information "
"such as the system's IP address. However, you should still go through this "
"chapter, as it also describes the available types of installation media and "
"how to prepare boot media and installation sources."

msgid ""
"If you already have Fedora installed and want to upgrade your installation "
"to the current version, there are two basic ways to do so:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Automatic upgrade using <application>FedUp</application>"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The preferred way to upgrade your system is an automatic upgrade using the "
"<application>FedUp</application> utility. For information on performing an "
"automatic upgrade, see <xref linkend=\"sect-upgrading-fedora-fedup\" />."
msgstr ""

msgid "Manual Reinstallation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can upgrade to the latest version of Fedora manually instead of relying "
"on <application>FedUp</application>. This involves booting the installer as "
"if you were performing a clean installation, letting it detect your existing "
"Fedora system, and overwriting the root partition while preserving data on "
"other partitions and volumes. The same process can also be used to reinstall "
"the system, if you need to. For detailed information, see <xref linkend="

msgid "Verifying the Downloaded Image"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because transmission errors or other problems may corrupt the Fedora image "
"you have downloaded, it is important to verify the file's integrity. After "
"the images are created, an operation is performed on the file that produces "
"a value called a <literal>checksum</literal> using a complex mathematical "
"algorithm. The operation is sufficiently complex that <emphasis>any change</"
"emphasis> to the original file will produce a different checksum."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By calculating the image's <literal>checksum</literal> on your own computer "
"and comparing it to the original <literal>checksum</literal>, you can verify "
"the image has not been tampered with or corrupted. The original checksum "
