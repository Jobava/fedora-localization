"allowing you to configure authentication settings - the <systemitem class="

"Before you finish the installation and reboot, either remove the media (CD, "
"DVD or a USB drive) which you used to start the installation, or make sure "
"that your system tries to boot from the hard drive before trying removable "
"media. Otherwise, your computer will start the installer again instead of "
"the installed system."
