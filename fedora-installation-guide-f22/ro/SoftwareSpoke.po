"It is not possible to select specific packages during a manual installation. "
"You can only select pre-defined environments and add-ons. If you need to "
"control exactly which packages are installed, you must use a Kickstart file "

"<xref linkend=\"chap-kickstart-installations\" /> for information about "
"Kickstart installations."

"The availability of environments and add-ons depends on your installation "
"source. By default, the selection depends on the installation media you used "
"to start the installation; Fedora&nbsp;Server installation image will have "
"different environments and add-ons available for selection than, for "
"example, the Fedora&nbsp;Cloud image. You can change this by configuring a "
"different installation source containing different environments."
