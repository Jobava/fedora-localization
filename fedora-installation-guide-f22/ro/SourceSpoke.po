msgid "Installation Source"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The <guilabel>Installation Source</guilabel> screen allows you to specify a "
"location (local or on the network) from which packages will be downloaded "
"and installed on your system. This screen will be configured automatically "
"in most cases, but you can change your settings or add additional sources."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Normally, when you first enter the <guilabel>Installation Summary</guilabel> "
"screen, the installer will attempt to configure an installation source based "
"on the type of media you used to boot. The full &PRODUCT; Server DVD will "
"configure the source as local media, the netinst ISO image will configure "
"the closest network mirror, etc. This process takes some time, especially if "
"the default source is a network mirror. If you plan to use a custom "
"installation source, use the <option>inst.askmethod</option> boot option to "
"skip the initial configuration; this will allow you to enter this screen "
"immediately. See <xref linkend=\"sect-boot-options-sources\" /> for "
"information about boot options."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following options are available. Note that not all of them may be "
"displayed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Auto-detected installation media"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is the option selected by default if you started the installer from "
"media containing an installation source, such as a live DVD. No additional "
"configuration is necessary. You can click the <guilabel>Verify</guilabel> "
"button check the media integrity."
msgstr ""

msgid "ISO file"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This option will appear if the installation program detected a partitioned "
"hard drive with mountable file systems during boot. Select this option, "
"click the <guibutton>Choose an ISO</guibutton> button, and browse to the "
"installation ISO file's location on your system. You can click the "
"<guilabel>Verify</guilabel> button to check the file's integrity."
msgstr ""

msgid "On the network"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use this option to download packages to be installed from a network location "
"instead of local media. This is the default selection on network "
"installation media."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In most cases, the <guilabel>Closest mirror</guilabel> option available from "
"the protocol selection drop-down menu is preferable. If this option is "
"selected, packages for your system will be downloaded from the most suitable "
"location (mirror)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To manually configure a network-based installation source, use the drop-down "
"menu to specify the protocol to be used when downloading packages. This "
"setting depends on the server you want to use. Then, type the server address "
"(without the protocol) into the address field. If you choose NFS, a second "
"input field will appear where you can specify custom <guilabel>NFS mount "
"options</guilabel>."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When selecting an NFS installation source, you must specify the address with "
"a colon (<literal>:</literal>) character separating the host name from the "
"path. For example:"

msgid ""
"<literal><replaceable>server.example.com</replaceable>:<replaceable>/path/to/"
"directory</replaceable></literal>"

"To configure a proxy for an HTTP or HTTPS source, click the <guibutton>Proxy "

"server requires authentication, check <guilabel>Use Authentication</"
"guilabel> and enter your user name and password. Click <guibutton>OK</"

"If your HTTP or HTTPS URL refers to a repository mirror list, mark the check "
"box under the address field."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also specify additional repositories in the <guilabel>Additional "
"repositories</guilabel> section to gain access to more installation "
"environments and software add-ons. All environments and add-ons will be "
"available for selection in <xref linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-software-"

"To add a repository, click the <guibutton>+</guibutton> button. To delete a "

"i.e. to replace current entries with those that were present at the time you "
