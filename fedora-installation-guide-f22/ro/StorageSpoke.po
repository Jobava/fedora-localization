msgid "Installation Destination"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The <guilabel>Installation Destination</guilabel> screen allows you to "
"configure storage options - namely, which disks will be used as the "
"installation target for your &PRODUCT; installation. At least one disk must "
"always be selected for the installation to proceed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For information about the theory and concepts behind disk partitioning in "
"Linux, see <xref linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-manual-partitioning-"

msgid ""
"If you plan to use a disk which already contains some data - for example, if "
"you want to shrink an existing Microsoft Windows partition and install "
"&PRODUCT; as a second system or if you are upgrading a previous release of "
"&PRODUCT;, make sure to back up any important data first. Manipulating "
"partitions always carries a risk - if the process is interrupted or fails "
"for any reason (installer error, hardware failure, power outage, etc.), any "
"data already on the disk may become impossible to recover."

msgid ""
"In the top part of the screen, all locally available storage devices (SATA, "
"IDE and SCSI hard drives, USB flash drives, etc.) are displayed in the "
"<guilabel>Local Standard Disks</guilabel> section. Local disks are detected "

"Then, connect any new hard drives you want to make available during the "

"<guilabel>Automatically configure partitioning</guilabel> - If this option "

"corner of the screen, the installer will determine the total amount of space "
"on all selected disks, and it will create a <firstterm>Logical Volume "
"Management</firstterm> (LVM) layout suitable for your system. The specifics "
"of this layout depend on whether your system uses BIOS or UEFI firmware, the "
"total amount of free space on your disks, and the amount of RAM on your "
"system (which determines the size of your swap space)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With automatic partitioning, you can also select the <guilabel>I would like "

msgid ""
"<guilabel>I will configure partitioning</guilabel> - Select this option and "
