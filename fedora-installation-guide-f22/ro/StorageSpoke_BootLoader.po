"&PRODUCT; uses <application>GRUB2</application> (GRand Unified Bootloader "
"version 2) as its boot loader. The boot loader is the first program that "
"runs when the computer starts and is responsible for loading and "
"transferring control to an operating system. <application>GRUB2</"
"application> can boot any compatible operating system (including Microsoft "
"Windows) and can also use chain loading to transfer control to other boot "
"loaders for unsupported operating systems."

msgid ""
"Installing <application>GRUB2</application> may overwrite your existing boot "
"loader."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you have other operating systems already installed, the &PRODUCT; "
"installer will attempt to automatically detect and configure the boot loader "
"to start them. You can manually configure any additional operating systems "
"after you finish the installation, if they are not detected properly. For "
"instructions on editing <application>GRUB2</application> configuration, see "
"the <citetitle>&PRODUCT; System&nbsp;Administrator's&nbsp;Guide</citetitle>, "

"If you are installing Fedora system with more than one disk, you may want to "
"manually specify where the bootloader should be installed. Click the "
"<guilabel>Full disk summary and bootloader</guilabel> link at the bottom of "
"the <guilabel>Installation Destination</guilabel> screen. The "
"<guilabel>Selected Disks</guilabel> dialog will appear. The bootloader will "
"be installed on the device of your choice, or on a UEFI system, the "
"<systemitem class=\"resource\">EFI system partition</systemitem> will be "

"In the <guilabel>Boot</guilabel> column, a \"tick\" icon marks one of the "
"devices as the intended boot device. To change the boot device, select a "
"device from the list and click the <guilabel>Set as Boot Device</guilabel> "
"button to install the boot loader there instead. Only one device can be set "
"as the boot device."

"To decline installation of a new boot loader, select the device currently "
"marked for boot and click the <guilabel>Do not install bootloader</guilabel> "

"If you choose not to install a boot loader for any reason, you will not be "
"able to boot the system directly, and you must use another boot method, such "
"as a stand-alone commercial boot loader application. Use this option only if "
"you are sure you have another way to boot your system."

"The boot loader may also require a special partition to be created, "
"depending on whether your system uses BIOS or UEFI firmware and also "
"depending on whether the boot drive has a <firstterm>GUID Partition Table</"
"firstterm> (GPT) or a <guilabel>Master Boot Record</guilabel> (MBR, also "
"known as msdos) label. If you use automatic partitioning, the installer will "
"create this partition if needed. For details, see <xref linkend=\"sect-"
"installation-gui-manual-partitioning-recommended\" />."
