msgid ""
"The <guilabel>Installation Summary</guilabel> screen is the central location "
"for setting up an installation. Most of the options which can be configured "
"during the installation can be accessed from here."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you used a Kickstart option or a boot option to specify an installation "
"repository on a network, but no network is available at the start of the "
"installation, the installer will display the <guilabel>Network "
"Configuration</guilabel> screen for you to set up a network connection prior "
"to displaying the <guilabel>Installation Summary</guilabel> screen."

msgid ""
"The summary screen consists of several links to other screens, separated "
"into categories. These links can be in several different states, which are "
"graphically indicated:"

msgid ""
"A <emphasis>warning symbol</emphasis> (yellow triangle with an exclamation "
"mark) next to an icon means that a screen requires your attention before you "
"start the installation. This typically happens with the "
"<guilabel>Installation Destination</guilabel> screen, because even though "
"there is a default automatic partitioning variant, you always have to at "
"least confirm this selection, even if you do not want to make any changes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a link is <emphasis>greyed out</emphasis>, it means that the installer is "
"currently configuring this section, and you must wait for the configuration "
"to finish before accessing that screen. This typically happens when you "
"change the installation source in the <guilabel>Installation Source</"
"guilabel> screen and the installer is probing the new source location and "
"gathering a list of available packages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Screens with <emphasis>black text and no warning symbol</emphasis> mean that "
"this screen does not require your attention. You can still change your "
"settings in these screens, but it is not necessary to do so to complete the "
"installation. This typically happens with localization settings, as these "
"are either detected automatically, or set up on the previous screen where "
"you select your language and locale."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A warning message is displayed at the bottom of the summary screen, and the "
"<guilabel>Begin Installation</guilabel> button is greyed out, as long as at "
"least one item has not been configured yet."

"Each screen also has an explanatory text below its title, showing settings "
"currently configured in that screen. This text may be concatenated; in that "
"case, move your mouse cursor over it and wait until a tooltip with the full "
"text appears."

"Once you configure everything required for the installation, you can press "
"the <guilabel>Begin Installation</guilabel> button to start installing "
"&PRODUCT;. This will take you to <xref linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-"
"installation-progress\" />. Note that as the text below this button says, "
"nothing will be written to your hard drive before you press this button. You "
"can press <guilabel>Quit</guilabel> at any point; this will discard all "
"changes you made in the installer so far and reboot the system."
