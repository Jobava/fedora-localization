msgid "Understanding LVM"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"LVM (Logical Volume Management) partitions provide a number of advantages "
"over standard partitions. LVM partitions are formatted as "
"<firstterm>physical volumes</firstterm>. One or more physical volumes are "
"combined to form a <firstterm>volume group</firstterm>. Each volume group's "
"total storage is then divided into one or more <firstterm>logical volumes</"
"firstterm>. The logical volumes function much like standard partitions. They "
"have a file system type, such as <systemitem class=\"filesystem\">ext4</"
"systemitem>, and a mount point."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The boot loader cannot read LVM volumes. You must make a standard, non-LVM "
"disk partition for your <filename class=\"partition\">/boot</filename> "
"partition."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, the installation process always creates the <filename class="
"\"partition\">/</filename> and <filename class=\"partition\">swap</filename> "
"partitions within LVM volumes, with a separate <filename>/boot</filename> on "
"a standard partition. See <xref linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-manual-"
"partitioning-recommended\" /> for details."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To understand LVM better, imagine the physical volume as a pile of "
"<firstterm>blocks</firstterm>. A block is a storage unit used to store data. "
"Several piles of blocks can be combined to make a much larger pile, just as "
"physical volumes are combined to make a volume group. The resulting pile can "
"be subdivided into several smaller piles of arbitrary size, just as a volume "
"group is allocated to several logical volumes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An administrator may grow or shrink logical volumes without destroying data, "
"unlike standard disk partitions. If the physical volumes in a volume group "
"are on separate drives or RAID arrays then administrators may also spread a "
"logical volume across the storage devices."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may lose data if you shrink a logical volume to a smaller capacity than "
"the data on the volume requires. To ensure maximum flexibility, create "
"logical volumes to meet your current needs, and leave excess storage "
"capacity unallocated. You may safely grow logical volumes to use unallocated "
"space, as your needs dictate."
