msgid ""
"This chapter explains how to upgrade your existing &PRODUCT; installation to "
"the current release. There are two basic ways to do so:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Automatic upgrade using <application>FedUp</application>"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The preferred way to upgrade your system is an automatic upgrade using the "
"<application>FedUp</application> utility. For information on performing an "
"automatic upgrade, see <xref linkend=\"sect-upgrading-fedora-fedup\" />."
msgstr ""

msgid "Manual Reinstallation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can upgrade to the latest version of Fedora manually instead of relying "
"on <application>FedUp</application>. This involves booting the installer as "
"if you were performing a clean installation, letting it detect your existing "
"Fedora system, and overwriting the root partition while preserving data on "
"other partitions and volumes. The same process can also be used to reinstall "
"the system, if you need to. For detailed information, see <xref linkend="
"\"sect-upgrading-fedora-manual-reinstall\" />."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Always back up your data before performing an upgrade or reinstalling your "
"system, no matter which method you choose."

msgid "Automatic System Upgrade Using FedUp"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unfortunately, we have not written this chapter yet. In the meantime before "
"we fix this, you can follow the instructions at <ulink url=\"https://"
"fedoraproject.org/wiki/FedUp\" />."
msgstr ""

msgid "Manual System Upgrade or Reinstallation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unfortunately, we have not written this chapter yet, and there is no "
"dedicated documentation about a manual reinstall on the Wiki, either. In the "
"meantime before we fix this, you can try to start the installation normally "
"(from a boot CD/DVD/USB), select manual partitioning in your installer, and "
"reuse existing partitions instead of destroying them and creating new ones. "
"The instructions at <xref linkend=\"sect-installation-gui-manual-"
"partitioning\" /> should in most cases be easy to adapt for this."
