msgid "Installing Using VNC"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The graphical installation interface is the recommended method of installing "
"&PRODUCT;. However, in some cases, accessing the graphical interface "
"directly is difficult or impossible. Some systems lack the capability to "
"connect a display and a keyboard, making VNC a necessity for manual (non-"
"Kickstart) installations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To allow manual installations on <firstterm>headless systems</firstterm> "
"(systems without a directly connected display, keyboard and mouse), the "
"<application>Anaconda</application> installation program includes a "
"<firstterm>Virtual Network Computing</firstterm> (VNC) mode which allows the "
"graphical mode of the installation program to run locally, but display on "
"another system connected to the network. The VNC installation provides you "
"with the full range of installation options."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This chapter provides instructions on activating VNC mode on the "
"installation system and connecting to it using a VNC viewer."
msgstr ""

msgid "Installing a VNC Viewer"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Performing a VNC installation requires a VNC viewer running on your "
"workstation or another terminal computer. VNC viewers are available in the "
"repositories of most Linux distributions; free VNC viewers are also "
"available for other operating systems such as Windows. On Linux systems, use "
"your package manager to search for a viewer for your distribution."
msgstr ""

msgid "The following VNC viewers are available in &PRODUCT;:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<application>TigerVNC</application> - A basic viewer independent of your "
"desktop environment. Installed as the <package>tigervnc</package> package."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<application>Vinagre</application> - A viewer for the <application>GNOME</"
"application> desktop environment. Installed as the <package>vinagre</"
"package> package."

msgid ""
"<application>KRDC</application> - A viewer integrated with the "
"<application>KDE</application> desktop environment. Installed as the "
"<package>kdenetwork-krdc</package> package."

"To install any of the viewers listed above, execute the following command as "
"<systemitem>root</systemitem>:"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Replace <replaceable>package</replaceable> with the package name of the "
"viewer you want to use (for example, <package>tigervnc</package>)."

"Procedures in this chapter assume you are using <application>TigerVNC</"
"application> as your VNC viewer. Specific instructions for other viewers may "
"differ, but the general principles still apply."
msgstr ""

msgid "Performing a VNC Installation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The <application>Anaconda</application> installation program offers two "
"modes for VNC installation: <firstterm>Direct mode</firstterm> and "
"<firstterm>Connect mode</firstterm>. The modes differ in the way the "
"connection between the server and viewer is established. After you "
"successfully connect, the installation will progress the same way regardless "
"of the mode you used."
msgstr ""

msgid "Direct Mode"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this mode, <application>Anaconda</application> is configured to start the "
"installation and wait for an incoming connection from VNC viewer before "
"proceeding. While waiting for an incoming connection, the system's IP "
"address and the port on which the installer expects the connection is "
"displayed on the display or console if available; this implies that you need "
"at least a serial console to connect using this mode, but you can work "
"around this limitation if you know the default VNC port and the system's IP "
"address."
msgstr ""

msgid "Connect Mode"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this mode, the VNC viewer is started on the remote system in "
"<firstterm>listening mode</firstterm>. The VNC viewer waits for an incoming "
"connection on a specified port. Then, <application>Anaconda</application> is "
"started and the host name/IP address and port number of the viewer are "
"provided using a boot option or a Kickstart command. When the installation "
"begins, the installation program establishes a connection with the listening "
"VNC viewer using the specified host name/IP address and port number. Connect "
"mode is therefore easier to use on systems with no local display or console, "
"but it also may require additional preparation, because the viewer system "
"must be able to accept incoming connections on the specified port, which "
"usually requires changing firewall settings."
