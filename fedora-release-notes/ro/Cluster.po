"The Apache Ambari project is aimed at making Hadoop management simpler by "
"developing software for provisioning, managing, and monitoring Apache Hadoop "
"clusters. Ambari provides an intuitive, easy-to-use Hadoop management web UI "

"Apache Mesos is a cluster manager that provides efficient resource isolation "
"and sharing across distributed applications, or frameworks. It abstracts "
"CPU, memory, storage, and other compute resources away from machines "
"(physical or virtual), enabling fault-tolerant and elastic distributed "
"systems to easily be built and run effectively. Apache Mesos is built using "
"the same principles as the Linux kernel, only at a different level of "
"abstraction. The Mesos kernel runs on every machine and provides "
"applications (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Elastic Search) with APIs for "
"resource management and scheduling across entire data center and cloud "
"environments."

"Apache Oozie is a workflow scheduler to manage Hadoop jobs. It is integrated "
"with the rest of the Hadoop stack and supports several types of Hadoop jobs "
"out of the box (such as Java map-reduce, Streaming map-reduce, Pig, Hive, "
"Sqoop and Distcp) as well as system specific jobs (such as Java programs and "
"shell scripts)."

"Apache Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets that consists of a "
"high-level language for expressing data analysis programs, coupled with "
"infrastructure for evaluating these programs. The salient property of Pig "
"programs is that their structure is amenable to substantial parallelization, "
"which, in turn, enables them to handle very large data sets. At the present "
"time, Pig's infrastructure layer consists of a compiler that produces "
"sequences of Map-Reduce programs, for which large-scale parallel "
"implementations already exist (e.g., the Hadoop sub-project)."

"Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. "
"It supports developing custom analytic processing applications over large "
"data sets or streaming data. Because it has the capability to cache "
"intermediate results in cluster memory and schedule DAGs of computations, "
"Spark programs can run up to 100x faster than equivalent Hadoop MapReduce "
"jobs. Spark applications are easy to develop, parallel, fast, and resilient "
"to failure, and they can operate on data from in-memory collections, local "
"files, a Hadoop-compatible filesystem, or from a variety of streaming "
"sources. Spark also includes libraries for distributed machine learning and "
"graph algorithms."
