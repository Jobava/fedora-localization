"The Apache Accumulo sorted, distributed key/value store is a robust, "
"scalable, high performance data storage and retrieval system. Apache "
"Accumulo is based on Google's BigTable design and is built on top of Apache "
"Hadoop, Zookeeper, and Thrift. Apache Accumulo features a few novel "
"improvements on the BigTable design in the form of cell-based access control "
"and a server-side programming mechanism that can modify key/value pairs at "
"various points in the data management process."

"Apache HBase is used when you need random, real-time read/write access to "
"your Big Data. Apache HBase hosts very large tables -- billions of rows X "
"millions of columns -- atop clusters of commodity hardware. Apache HBase is "
"a distributed, versioned, non-relational database modeled after Google's "
"Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data by Chang et al. "
"Just as Bigtable leverages the distributed data storage provided by the "
"Google File System, Apache HBase provides Bigtable-like capabilities on top "
"of Hadoop and HDFS."

"The Apache Hive data warehouse software facilitates querying and managing "
"large data sets residing in distributed storage. Hive provides a mechanism "
"to project structure onto this data and query the data using a SQL-like "
"language called HiveQL. At the same time this language also allows "
"traditional map/reduce programmers to plug in their custom mappers and "
"reducers when it is inconvenient or inefficient to express this logic in "
"HiveQL."
