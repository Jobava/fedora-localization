"The NFS Ganesha file server is a new package in F21. It is a user-mode file "
"server for NFS (v3, v4.0 , v4.1 pNFS) and for 9P from the Plan 9 operating "
"system. It integrates with backend filesystems via its File System "
"Abstraction Layer (FSAL) which is a set of loadable modules that implement "
"the access to these filesystems. Using a FSAL is similar to FUSE in that the "
"whole filesystem can be implemented in user space. This is especially "
"advantageous for pNFS and distributed filesystems where storage is "
"distributed across a network."
