"Fedora &PRODVER; provides software to suit a wide variety of applications. "
"The storage, memory and processing requirements vary depending on usage. For "
"example, a high traffic database server requires much more memory and "
"storage than a business desktop, which in turn has higher requirements than "
"a single-purpose virtual machine."
