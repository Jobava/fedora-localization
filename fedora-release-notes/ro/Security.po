"SSSD now supports centrally managed, host-based access control in an Active "
"Directory (AD) environment, using Group Policy Objects (GPOs)."

msgid ""
"GPO policy settings are commonly used to manage host-based access control in "
"an AD environment. SSSD supports local logons, remote logons, service logons "
"and more. Each of these standard GPO security options can be mapped to any "
"PAM service, allowing administrators to comprehensively configure their "
"systems."

"This enhancement to SSSD is related only to the retrieval and enforcement of "
"AD policy settings. Administrators can continue to use the existing AD tool "
"set to specify policy settings."

"The new functionality only affects SSSD's AD provider and has no effect on "
"any other SSSD providers (e.g. IPA provider). By default, SSSD's AD provider "
"will be installed in \"permissive\" mode, so that it won't break upgrades. "
"Administrators will need to set \"enforcing\" mode manually (see sssd-ad(5))."

"OpenSSL was patched to disallow verification of certificates that are signed "
"with MD5 algorithm. The use of MD5 hash algorithm for certificate signatures "
"is now considered as insecure and thus all the main crypto libraries in "
"Fedora were patched to reject such certificates."

"Certificates signed with MD5 algorithm are not present on public https web "
"sites anymore but they may still be in use on private networks or used for "
"authentication on openvpn based VPNs. It is highly recommended to replace "
"such certificates with new ones signed with SHA256 or at least SHA1. As a "
"temporary measure the <envar>OPENSSL_ENABLE_MD5_VERIFY</envar> environment "
"variable can be set to allow verification of certificates signed with MD5 "
"algorithm."
