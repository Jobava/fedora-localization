"A technique often used for studio recordings is to separately record parts "

"example, consider a recording where one trumpeter wants to record both parts "
"of a solo written for two trumpets. The orchestra could be brought into the "
"studio, and would play the entire solo piece without any trumpet solo. "
"<application>Ardour</application> will record this on one track. Then, the "
"trumpet soloist goes to the studio, and uses <application>Ardour</"
"application> to simultaneously listen to the previously-recorded orchestra "
"track while playing one of the solo trumpet parts, which is recorded onto "
"another track. The next day, the trumpeter returns to the studio, and uses "
"<application>Ardour</application> to listen to the previously-recorded "
"orchestra track and previously-recorded solo trumpet part while playing the "
"other solo trumpet part, which is recorded onto a third track. The recording "
"engineer uses Audacity's mixing and editing features to make it sound as "
