"Audacity is a high-quality sound recording application, designed to be easy "
"to use. We recommend Audacity to most computer users, because it is simple "

"advanced computer audio concepts before using Audacity. If you can connect "
"your microphone to your computer, you know enough to use Audacity."

"Audacity has a simple user interface, it is easy to use, and it has many "
"advanced capabilities. Audacity does not require advanced knowledge of "
"computers, music, or recording. Audacity is the right tool to use for "
"editing a single audio file, and it can also coordinate multiple audio files "
"simultaneously. Most users will prefer Audacity over the other applications "
"in the Musicians' Guide which can record."

"If you have professional-quality audio equipment, if you want to do highly "

"Rosegarden. Ardour and Rosegarden are more complicated than Qtractor, and "
