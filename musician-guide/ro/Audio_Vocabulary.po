"The perceived <firstterm>volume</firstterm> or <firstterm>loudness</"
"firstterm> of sound is a complex phenomenon not entirely understood by "
"experts. One widely-agreed method of assessing loudness is by measuring the "
"sound pressure level (SPL), which is measured in decibels (dB) or bels (B, "
"equal to ten decibels). In audio production communities, this is called "
"level. The <firstterm>level</firstterm> of an audio signal is one way of "

"There are many different ways to monitor and adjust the level of an audio "
"signal, and there is no widely-agreed practice. One reason for this "
"situation is the technical limitations of recorded audio. Most level meters "
"are designed so that the average level is -6&nbsp;dB on the meter, and the "
"maximum level is 0&nbsp;dB. This practice was developed for analog audio. We "
"recommend using an external meter and the \"K-system,\" described in a link "

"There is a growing trend toward five- and seven-channel audio, driven "

"Two \"surround-sound\" formats exist for music: DVD Audio (DVD-A) and Super "

"them, is held back by the proliferation of headphones with personal MP3 "
"players, a general lack of desire for improvement in audio quality amongst "
"consumers, and the copy-protection measures put in place by record labels. "
"The result is that, while some consumers are willing to pay higher prices "

"you buy a DVD-A or SACD-capable player, you would need to replace all of "
"your audio equipment with models that support proprietary copy-protection "
