"The term <firstterm>Digital Audio Workstation</firstterm> (henceforth "
"<firstterm>DAW</firstterm>) refers to the entire hardware and software setup "
"used for professional (or professional-quality) audio recording, "
"manipulation, synthesis, and production. It originally referred to devices "
"purpose-built for the task, but as personal computers have become more "
"powerful and wide-spread, certain specially-designed personal computers can "
"also be thought of as DAWs. The software running on these computers, "
"especially software capable of multi-track recording, playback, and "
"synthesis, is simply called \"DAW software,\" which is often shortened to "
"\"DAW.\" So, the term \"DAW\" and its usage are moderately ambiguous, but "
"generally refer to one of the things mentioned."

"Recording is the process of capturing audio regions (also called \"clips\" "

"complex process, involving a microphone that captures sound energy, "
"translates it into electrical energy, and transmits it to an audio interface."
" The audio interface converts the electrical energy into digital signals, "
"and sends it through the operating system to the DAW software. The DAW "
"stores regions in memory and on the hard drive as required. Every time the "
"musicians perform some (or all) of the performance to be recorded, while the "
