"<application>FluidSynth</application> is a software-based MIDI synthesizer. "
"<application>FluidSynth</application> accepts MIDI input from programs like "
"Qtractor and Rosegarden, and uses SoundFont technology to create audio "
"signals. This makes <application>FluidSynth</application> a very flexible "
"tool; it can be used even on low-power computers, doesn't require "
"specialized hardware, and can take advantage of a wide selection of high-"
"quality MIDI instruments. When used with the <application>Qsynth</"
"application> graphical interface, <application>FluidSynth</application> "
"becomes even more powerful: users can easily control basic effects like "
"chorus and reverb, and they can start multiple <application>FluidSynth</"
"application> synthesizers, each with their own settings and MIDI instrument "
"assignments. Finally, because <application>Qsynth</application> was created "
"and is maintained by the same developers as Qtractor and QjackCtl, it "
"provides a familiar interface, and integrates well with these other "
"applications."

"SoundFont technology was developed in the early 1990s, and comprises a file "
"format and certain hardware technologies designed to allow the creation of "
"MIDI instruments that sound like acoustic instruments. It would be virtually "
"impossible to make an electronically-synthesized instrument sound identical "
"to an acoustic counterpart, but SoundFont technology enables the gap to "
"narrow considerably. Heard in the right context, most people would not "
"notice that music was recorded by a SoundFont-capable MIDI synthesizer, but "
"results can vary widely."

"What <application>FluidSynth</application> enables users to do is eliminate "

"SoundFonts change the sound of MIDI notes - the overall meaning is the same "
