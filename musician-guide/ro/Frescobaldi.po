"Frescobaldi is an advanced text editor, designed specifically for use with "
"LilyPond source files. Its interface has been crafted in such a way that it "
"aids the average workflow of creating and editing musical scores in LilyPond."
" Frescobaldi's tight integration with various system tools is similar to the "
"way LilyPond itself is tightly integrated with various other software "
"programs."

"Frescobaldi is designed to take advantage of several features of the KDE 4 "
"desktop system. Regular KDE users will immediately recognize Frescobaldi's "
"components as being identical to several other key KDE applications - "
"specifically Kate, Okular, and Konqueror. The key advantage to this approach "
"is that KDE users will already know how to use most of the features of "
"Frescobaldi, because those other applications are not just replicated, but "
"actually used by Frescobaldi. There are many other advantages to this "
"development approach."

"For non-KDE users - especially those with older computers, this KDE-based "
"approach may be more of a hassle than a help. An unfortunate side-effect of "
"this development choice is that Frescobaldi has many \"dependencies\" in KDE "
"packages, meaning that some KDE software will need to be installed in order "
"to use Frescobaldi. This is a significant disadvantage for some users, but "
"the benefits of using Frescobaldi far outweigh the extra hard drive space "
"that will be required."
