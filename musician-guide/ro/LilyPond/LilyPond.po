"Other proprietary and free engraving (or &ldquo;notation&rdquo;) programs, "
"like <application>MuseScore</application> and <application>Denemo</"
"application>, focus on the visual aspects of musical scores, "
"<application>LilyPond</application> focusses on the semantic aspects. "
"Because <application>LilyPond</application> is a text-based music engraving "
"program, the separation between meaning and appearance is similar to HTML "
"and CSS. Web developers use HTML to tell web browsers what an object means "
"(a &lt;title&gt; tag tells a browser that some text is a title, for "
"example), and CSS to tell web browsers how objects with different meaning "
"should look (that all titles are blue, for example). The LilyPond language "
"does not look like HTML and CSS, but you may have a similar experience. "
"<application>LilyPond</application> users use letters and numbers to tell "
"<application>LilyPond</application> what a note means (a &ldquo;g4&rdquo; is "
"the pitch G with a quarter-note duration, for example), and can change the "
"visual appearance if they wish (by using a square notehead, for example)."

"When you use <application>LilyPond</application>, think of musical objects "
"in two ways: what it is or means, and how it looks. You should focus on "
"which objects to use and what they mean, then adjust how they look as you "
"need. The <application>LilyPond</application> developers spend a lot of "
"effort to ensure most musical scores are visually appealling with little "
"adjustment."

"After you prepare a specially-formatted text file for <application>LilyPond</"
"application>, the program uses many different components to decide how the "
"score will look. For every type of musical object, <application>LilyPond</"
"application> has a specific rendering component. When a component creates a "
"musical object in a score, the component considers several alternative "
"appearances, then chooses only one."
