"As stated on the project's home page, it is the goal of Planet CCRMA at Home "
"to provide packages which will transform a &OPERATING_SYSTEM;-based computer "
"into an audio workstation. What this means is that, while the &O_S; Project "
"does an excellent job of providing a general-purpose operating system, a "
"general purpose operating system is insufficient for audio work of the "
"highest quality. The contributors to Planet CCRMA at Home provide software "
"packages which can tune your system specifically for audio work."

"CCRMA stands for \"Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics,\" "
"which is the name of an academic research initiative and music computing "
"facility at Stanford University, located in Stanford, California. Its "
"initiatives help scholars to understand the effects and possibilities of "
"computers and technology in various musical contexts. They offer academic "
"courses, hold workshops and concerts, and try to incorporate the work of "
"many highly-specialized fields."

"The only useful reason to install an additional repository is if you intend "
"to install and use its software. The only software application covered in "
"this guide, which is available exclusively from the Planet CCRMA at Home "

"Most of the audio software currently available in the default &O_S; "

"The biggest reason that you should avoid installing the Planet CCRMA at Home "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Planet CCRMA is intended for specialized audio workstations. The software is "
"packaged in such a way that creates potential (and unknown) security threats "
"caused by the optimizations necessary to prepare a computer system for use "
"in audio work. Furthermore, these optimizations may reveal software bugs "
"present in non-Planet CCRMA software, and allow them to do more damage than "
"on a non-optimized system. Finally, a computer system's \"stability\" (its "
"ability to run without trouble) may be compromised by audio optimizations. "
"Regular desktop applications may perform less well on audio-optimized "
"systems, if the optimization process unintentionally un-optimized some other "
"process."

"CCRMA is not a large, Linux-focussed organization. It is an academic "
"organization, and its primary intention with the Planet CCRMA at Home "
"repository is to allow anybody with a computer to do the same kind of work "
"that they do. The Fedora Project is a relatively large organization, backed "
"by one of the world's largest commercial Linux providers, which is focussed "
"on creating a stable and secure operating system for daily use. Furthermore, "
"thousands of people around the world are working for the Fedora Project or "
"its corporate sponsor, and it is their responsibility to proactively solve "
"problems. CCRMA has the same responsibility, but they do not have the "
"dedicated resources of the Fedora Project, it would be naive(???) to think "
"that they would be capable of providing the same level of support."

"All &OPERATING_SYSTEM; users should be grateful to the people working at "
"CCRMA, who help to provide the Planet CCRMA at Home repository. Their work "
"has been instrumental in allowing &O_S; to provide the amount of high-"
"quality audio software that it does. Furthermore, the availability of many "
"of CCRMA's highly-specialized software applications through the Planet CCRMA "
"at Home repository is an invaluable resource to audio and music enthusiasts."

"On the other hand, &O_S; users cannot expect that Planet CCRMA software is "
"going to meet the same standards as &O_S; software. While the Fedora "
"Project's primary goal is to provide Linux software, CCRMA's main goal is to "
"advance the state of knowledge of computer-based music and audio research "

"If you want to use your computer for both day-to-day desktop tasks and high-"
"quality audio production, one good solution is to \"dual-boot\" your "
"computer. This involves installing &OPERATING_SYSTEM; twice on the same "
"physical computer, but it will allow you to keep an entirely separate "
"operating system environment for the Planet CCRMA at Home software. Not only "
"will this allow you to safely and securely run Planet CCRMA applications in "
"their most-optimized state, but you can help to further optimize your system "
"by turning off and even removing some system services that you do not need "
"for audio work. For example, a GNOME or KDE user might choose to install "
"only \"Openbox\" for their audio-optimized installation."
msgstr ""

#. Tag: para
#, no-c-format

"Alternatively, there is the possibility of going half-way: installing only "
"some Planet CCRMA applications, but not the fully-optimized kernel and "
"system components. This would be more suitable for a computer used most "
"often for typical day-to-day operations (email, word processing, web "
"browsing, etc.) If you wanted to use SuperCollider, but did not require "
"other audio software, for example, then this might be the best solution for "
"you."
