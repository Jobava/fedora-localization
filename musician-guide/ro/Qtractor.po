"<application>Qtractor</application> is a relatively new application, created "
"and maintained by the same developers who are responsible for "
"<application>QjackCtl</application> and <application>Qsynth</application> "
"(both covered in other chapters of this Guide). It offers much more "
"flexibility than <application>Audacity</application>, but is still easier to "

"In this passage, I kept the \"a note followed by three beats of rest\" idea, "
"then added onto the melody by taking two cues from the audio file. The first "
"was the increasing surface rhythm of the upper part, which gave rise to the "
"\"three-descending-notes\" figures. The second was the fact that the chords "
"are still going on underneath that melody, so I added a second randomized "
"set of notes underneath my upper part. At the end of the passage I continued "
"the trend that I started with a finishing flourish that picks up sustained "
"notes."

"This part of piece was intended to mirror Beethoven's score quite obviously. "
"The only real bit of trickery that I played was looking at Beethoven's "
"score, and incorporating particular notes: the chord in measure 212 is "
"composed of the same pitches that are used in the chord in the audio file in "
"measure 210. It sounds very different because of the \"real piano vs. MIDI "
"piano\" issue, and because the tuning of the piano in the recording is "
"different than the tuning of the MIDI piano. Also, the chord in the second "
"beat of measure 213 is the first chord of the movement following the one "
"recorded in the audio file. By including this (then \"resolving\" it, then "
"re-introducing it), I intend to play with the expectations of a listener "
"that may already be familiar with Beethoven's sonata."
