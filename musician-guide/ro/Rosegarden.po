"Make a \"variations\" form: repeat the part that you've already created "
"several times, but make it slightly different every time. Try several "
"different ways of modifying it: add another melody to go along with the one "
"you have; add extra notes to the existing melody; change the percussion "
"track; write a new bassline; expand the melody so it takes twice as long; "
"combinations of these. Making a variation of an existing section is a common "
"way of making it take more time."
