"Audio interfaces are hardware devices that connect your computer and audio "
"equipment (like microphones and speakers). Audio interfaces convert signals "
"between analog and digital formats: signals enter the computer and pass "
"through an analog-to-digital converter; signals leave the computer and pass "
"through a digital-to-analog converter. Some audio interfaces have digital "
"input and output ports, so other devices perform the conversion between "
"analog and digital signal formats."

"The conversion between analog and digital audio signal formats is the "
"primary function of audio interfaces. Sound has an infinite range of pitch, "
"volume, and durational possibilities. Computers cannot process infinite "
"information, so sound is converted to a digital format. Digital sound "
"signals have a limited range of pitch, volume, and durational possibilities. "
"High-quality analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters change the "
"signal format in a way that keeps the original, analog signal as closely as "
"possible. The quality of the convertors is what determines the quality of an "
"audio interface."

"Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) is a standard used to control "
"digital musical devices. Many people associate the term with low-quality "
"imitations of acoustic instruments. This is unfortunate, because MIDI "
"signals themselves do not have a sound. MIDI signals are instructions to "
"control devices: they tell a synthesizer when to start and stop a note, how "
"long the note should be, and what pitch it should have. The synthesizer "
"follows these instructions and creates an audio signal. Many MIDI-controlled "
"synthesizers are low-quality imitations of acoustic instruments, but many "
"are high-quality imitations. MIDI-powered devices are used in many "
"mainstream and non-mainstream musical situations, and can be nearly "
"indistinguishable from actual acoustic instruments. MIDI interfaces only "
"transmit MIDI signals, not audio signals. Some audio interfaces have built-"
"in MIDI interfaces, allowing both interfaces to share the same physical "
"device."

"In order to create sound from MIDI signals, you need a \"MIDI synthesizer.\" "

"You can use MIDI signals, synthesizers, and applications without a hardware-"

"FireWire-connected sound cards are not as popular as USB-connected sound "
