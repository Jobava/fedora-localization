"One of the techniques consistently used in computer science is abstraction. "
"Abstraction is the process of creating a generic model for something (or "
"some things) that are actually unique. The \"driver\" for a hardware device "
"in a computer is one form of dealing with abstraction: the computer's "
"software interacts with all sound cards in a similar way, and it is the "
"driver which translates the universal instructions given by the software "
"into specific instructions for operating that hardware device. Consider this "
"real-world comparison: you know how to operate doors because of abstracted "
"instructions. You don't know how to open and close every door that exists, "
"but from the ones that you do know how to operate, your brain automatically "
"creates abstracted instructions, like \"turn the handle,\" and \"push the "
"door,\" which apply with all or most doors. When you see a new door, you "
"have certain expectations about how it works, based on the abstract behavior "
"of doors, and you quickly figure out how to operate that specific door with "
"a simple visual inspection. The principle is the same with computer hardware "
"drivers: since the computer already knows how to operate \"sound cards,\" it "
"just needs a few simple instructions (the driver) in order to know how to "
"operate any particular sound card."

"In Linux, the core of the operating system provides hardware drivers for "
"most audio hardware. The hardware drivers, and the instructions that other "
"software can use to connect to those drivers, are collectively called "
"\"ALSA,\" which stands for \"Advanced Linux Sound Architecture.\" ALSA is "
"the most direct way that software applications can interact with audio and "
"MIDI hardware, and it used to be the most common way. However, in order to "
"include all the features that a software application might want to use, ALSA "
"is quite complex, and can be error-prone. For this and many other reasons, "
"another level of abstraction is normally used, and this makes it easier for "
"software applications to take advantage of the features they need."

"Sound servers are programs that run \"in the background,\" meaning that they "
"do not have a user interface. Sound servers provide a level of abstraction "
"to automate some aspects of using ALSA, and to allow multiple applications "
"to simultaneously access your audio hardware. The three sound servers "
"discussed in this chapter have different goals and different features. The "
"sound server you should use depends on what you are doing."

"<systemitem>PulseAudio</systemitem> is an advanced sound server, intended to "
"make audio programming in Linux operating systems as easy as possible. The "
"idea behind its design is that an audio application needs only to output "
"audio to <systemitem>PulseAudio</systemitem>. <systemitem>PulseAudio</"
"systemitem> will take care of the rest: choosing and controlling a "
"particular device, adjusting the volume, working with other applications, "
"and so on. <systemitem>PulseAudio</systemitem> even has the ability to use "
"\"networked sound,\" which allows two computers using "
"<systemitem>PulseAudio</systemitem> to communicate as though they were one "
"computer - either computer can input from or output to either computer's "
"audio hardware just as easily as its own audio hardware. This is all "
"controlled within <systemitem>PulseAudio</systemitem>, so no further "
"complication is added to the software."

"The Fedora Project's integration of <systemitem>PulseAudio</systemitem> as a "
"vital part of the operating system has helped to ensure that audio "
"applications can \"just work\" for most people under most circumstances. "

"The <systemitem>JACK</systemitem> sound server offers fewer features than "
"other sound servers but it is tailor-made to allow the functionality "
"required by audio creation applications. <systemitem>JACK</systemitem> also "
"makes it easier for users to configure the options that are most important "
"for such situations. The server supports only one sample rate and format at "
"a time, and allows applications and hardware to easily connect and multiplex "
"in ways that other sound servers do not (see <xref linkend=\"sect-"
"Musicians_Guide-Vocabulary-Routing_and_Multiplexing\" /> for information "
"about routing and multiplexing). It is also optimized to run with "
"consistently low latencies. Although using <systemitem>JACK</systemitem> "
"requires a better understanding of the underlying hardware, the "
"<application>QjackCtl</application> application provides a graphical user "
"interface to ease the process."

"Phonon is a sound server built into the KDE Software Compilation and is one "
"of the core components of KDE. By default on &OPERATING_SYSTEM;, Phonon "
"feeds output to <systemitem>PulseAudio</systemitem>, but on other platforms "
"(like Mac OS X, Windows, other versions of Linux, FreeBSD, and any other "
"system that supports KDE), Phonon can be configured to feed its output "
"anywhere. This is its greatest strength - that KDE applications like Amarok "
"and Dragon Player need only be programmed to use Phonon, and they can rely "
"on Phonon to take care of everything else. As KDE applications increasingly "
"find their place in Windows and especially Mac OS X, this cross-platform "
"capability is turning out to be very useful."
