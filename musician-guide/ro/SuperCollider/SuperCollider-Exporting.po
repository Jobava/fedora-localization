"<application>SuperCollider</application> allows you to synthesze audio "
"output to an audio file. Doing this requires using OSC commands on the "
"server, the <classname>DiskOut</classname> UGen, the <classname>Buffer</"
"classname> UGen, and other relatively advanced concepts. The built-in "
"<citetitle>DiskOut</citetitle> help file, available at <ulink url=\"http://"
"supercollider.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/supercollider/trunk/common/build/"
"Help/UGens/Playback%20and%20Recording/DiskOut.html\" />, contains some help "
"with the <classname>DiskOut</classname> UGen, and links to other useful help "
"files. This method is not further discussed here."
