"<systemitem class=\"protocol\">DNS</systemitem> (Domain Name System), is a "
"distributed database system that is used to associate host names with their "
"respective <systemitem class=\"protocol\">IP</systemitem> addresses. For "
"users, this has the advantage that they can refer to machines on the network "
"by names that are usually easier to remember than the numerical network "
"addresses. For system administrators, using a <systemitem class="
"\"protocol\">DNS</systemitem> server, also known as a <firstterm>nameserver</"
"firstterm>, enables changing the <systemitem class=\"protocol\">IP</"
"systemitem> address for a host without ever affecting the name-based queries."
" The use of the <systemitem class=\"protocol\">DNS</systemitem> databases is "
"not only for resolving <systemitem class=\"protocol\">IP</systemitem> "
"addresses to domain names and their use is becoming broader and broader as "
"DNSSEC is deployed."

"<systemitem class=\"protocol\">DNS</systemitem> is usually implemented using "
"one or more centralized servers that are authoritative for certain domains. "
"When a client host requests information from a nameserver, it usually "
"connects to port 53. The nameserver then attempts to resolve the name "
"requested. If the nameserver is configured to be a recursive name servers "
"and it does not have an authoritative answer, or does not already have the "
"answer cached from an earlier query, it queries other nameservers, called "
"<firstterm>root nameservers</firstterm>, to determine which nameservers are "
"authoritative for the name in question, and then queries them to get the "
"requested name. Nameservers configured as purely authoritative, with "
"recursion disabled, will not do lookups on behalf of clients."
